About 8 out of 10 people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity.8 Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, eye problems, nerve damage, and other health problems.\n\nIf you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight and getting regular physical activity may prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\nHigh blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which blood flows through your blood vessels with a force greater than normal. High blood pressure can strain your heart, damage blood vessels, and raise your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and death.\nDoctor checking the blood pressure of a man who has obesity. Overweight and obesity may raise your risk for certain health problems such as high blood pressure.\nHeart disease\n\nHeart disease is a term used to describe several problems that may affect your heart. If you have heart disease, you may have a heart attack, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, angina NIH external link, or an abnormal heart rhythm. High blood pressure, abnormal levels of blood fats, and high blood glucose levels may raise your risk for heart disease. Blood fats, also called blood lipids, include HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.\n\nLosing 5 to 10 percent of your weight may lower your risk factors for developing heart disease. If you weigh 200 pounds, this means losing as little as 10 pounds. Weight loss may improve blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood flow.\nStroke\n\nStroke is a condition in which the blood supply to your brain is suddenly cut off, caused by a blockage or the bursting of a blood vessel in your brain or neck. A stroke can damage brain tissue and make you unable to speak or move parts of your body. High blood pressure is the leading cause of strokes.\nSleep apnea\n\nSleep apnea is a common disorder in which you do not breathe regularly while sleeping. You may stop breathing altogether for short periods of time. Untreated sleep apnea may raise your risk of other health problems, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nMetabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that put you at risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. These conditions are\n\n    high blood pressure\n    high blood glucose levels\n    high triglyceride levels in your blood\n    low levels of HDL cholesterol (the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol) in your blood\n    too much fat around your waist\n\nFatty liver diseases\n\nFatty liver diseases are conditions in which fat builds up in your liver. Fatty liver diseases include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fatty liver diseases may lead to severe liver damage, cirrhosis, or even liver failure.\nOsteoarthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis is a common, long-lasting health problem that causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. Being overweight or having obesity may raise your risk of getting osteoarthritis by putting extra pressure on your joints and cartilage.\nGallbladder diseases\n\nOverweight and obesity may raise your risk of getting gallbladder diseases, such as gallstones and cholecystitis.

The researchers have labelled the syndrome vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.\n\nAmong more than 20 million people who have been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK so far, 79 cases of rare blood clots with low platelets have been reported, as well as 19 deaths. The European Medicines Agency and the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency have concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets are a possible and rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine but a causal relation has not been established.3 The EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is also investigating three cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets during the vaccine rollout of the Johnson &Johnson Janssen vaccine in the US.\n\nThe first paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, describes 11 patients in Austria and Germany, 9 of them women, with a median age of 36 years. They had clotting and low platelets between five to 16 days after vaccination. Nine patients had cerebral venous thrombosis, three had splanchnic vein thrombosis, three had pulmonary embolism, and four had other thromboses. Six of the patients died.\n\nAll 11 patients, as well as another 17 for whom the researchers had blood samples, tested positive for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are also observed in people who develop heparin induced thrombocytopenia. None of the patients had received heparin before their symptoms started, however.\n\n\u201cWhether these antibodies are autoantibodies against PF4 induced by the strong inflammatory stimulus of vaccination or antibodies induced by the vaccine that cross-react with PF4 and platelets requires further study,\u201d wrote Andreas Greinacher from the University of Griefswald in Germany, and his co-authors. They suggested that one possible trigger of these PF4 reactive antibodies could be free DNA in the vaccine.\n\nIn a second paper, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Norway described a similar pattern in five healthcare workers who were 32 to 54 years old. All had high levels of PF4 antibodies and no previous exposure to heparin. Four of the patients had major cerebral haemorrhage and three died.\n\nBoth sets of researchers suggested that doctors should have a low threshold for requesting enzyme linked immunosorbent assay testing for PF4-heparin antibodies in patients who have unexpected symptoms after vaccination. They suggested treatment with intravenous immune globulin and non-heparin blood thinners.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Peter English, retired consultant in communicable disease control, former editor of Vaccines in Practice, and immediate past chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said, \u201cThese papers do not tackle causality. They may turn out to be useful, in their technical details, for clinicians treating patients with clotting disorders, and for regulators and others in deciding the safest way to proceed once causality has been confirmed\u2014if it ever is. However, their small studies do not have the statistical power to, and are not designed to, prove causality\u201d\n\nOn 7 April, the UK\u2019s Expert Haematology Panel published guidance for the diagnosis and management of vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia which they say is rare but can affect patients of all ages and both sexes.4 They recommended urgent use of intravenous immunoglobulin, avoiding platelet transfusions, and anticoagulating with non-heparin based therapies. Probable cases must be reported to the panel and Public Health England at https://cutt.ly/haem_AE. Additionally, all cases of thrombosis or thrombocytopenia occurring within 28 days of covid-19 vaccine must be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency through the online yellow card system (https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk).\n\nThe MHRA has recommended that anyone who develops the following symptoms after vaccination should seek prompt medical advice\u2014shortness of breath, chest or persistent abdominal pain, leg swelling, blurred vision, confusion of seizures, unexplained pin prick rash, or bruising beyond the injection site.", "611274328171d2115806b073"]], "label": "SUPPORTS"}

These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.\n\nNo safety concerns were found in animal studies: Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.\nNo adverse pregnancy-related outcomes occurred in previous clinical trials that used the same vaccine platform as the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine: Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes affecting the baby, were associated with vaccination in these trials. Learn more about how viral vector vaccines work.\nCOVID-19 vaccines do not cause infection, including in pregnant people or their babies: None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 so a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make anyone sick with COVID-19, including pregnant people or their babies.\nEarly data on the safety of receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) during pregnancy are reassuring:\nCDC released the first U.S. data on the safety of receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The report analyzed data from three safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. These early data did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or their babies.1\nAnother report looked at pregnant people enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who were vaccinated before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Scientists did not find an increased risk for miscarriage among people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.2\nMany pregnancies reported in these safety monitoring systems are ongoing. CDC will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to better understand effects on pregnancy and babies.\nEarly data suggest receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy reduces the risk for infection: A recent study from Israel compared pregnant people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with those who did not. Scientists found that vaccination lowered the risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19.3\nVaccination of pregnant people builds antibodies that might protect their baby: When pregnant people receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, their bodies build antibodies against COVID-19, similar to non-pregnant people. Antibodies made after a pregnant person received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were found in umbilical cord blood. This means COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy might help protect babies against COVID-19. More data are needed to determine how these antibodies, similar to those produced with other vaccines, may provide protection to the baby.4\nAdditional clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received a vaccine and became pregnant.\n\n", "611a435c3f45b6c288196363"], ["SUPPORTS", "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/", "You can get vaccinated against COVID-19 if you're aged 16 or over and:\n\nyou're pregnant or think you might be\nyou're breastfeeding\nyou're trying for a baby or might get pregnant in the future\nThe vaccines you'll be offered depends if you're pregnant and how old you are.

As the vaccine enters your body and is pretending to be the infection, you may get some of the symptoms of that disease like a cold symptoms, or a slight fever that shows your body is fighting the infection. There may be soreness of muscles or redness at the injection site. All of these very mild side effects go away in a couple of days.\n\n Rare side effects.\nThere is a very rare chance you or your child could have more severe side effects that come from vaccines. High fevers, rashes, or neurological episodes are these very rare side effects. Medical professionals are trained to deal directly with these kinds of side effects, and each of them is extremely rare\u2014more rare than getting the disease that is being immunized against.\n\nBenefits of vaccinations.\nDisease control.\nVaccines are extremely effective at controlling or eliminating dangerous diseases. The World Health Organization reports that the measles vaccine has prevented more than 20 million deaths since 2000.\n\nSmallpox has been completely eradicated thanks to vaccinations, and polio is not far behind. Polio vaccines are still given to help keep control of the disease until it has been globally removed.\n\nImmunizations have a direct impact on disease and virus control in the United States, and across the globe. Immunizations have turned deadly, devastating diseases into preventable diseases that are no longer life-threatening.\n\n \nHerd immunity.\nWhen more people have vaccinations, it makes everyone less likely to get the disease that is vaccinated against. This control of diseases is called herd immunity, and benefits the entire community.\n\nFor example, routine measles vaccines are high in the United States, with 91% of preschool children vaccinated. Measles has an extremely low occurrence rate as a result. But as specific areas dip in the number of vaccines, outbreaks have been seen. In 2018, 17 measles outbreaks impacting more than 370 people were confirmed. This is a direct result of localized areas opting out of vaccines.\n\nWhen more people decide not to vaccinate, the diseases they prevent against have the potential to flare up or even get out of control. This is why research on vaccine safety is crucial; health professionals want to explain the slight risks of vaccines, and share how the benefits outweigh any risk because of things like herd immunity, that keep everyone safe.\n\nVaccines have been a hot topic for debate as research has come out about them. Many controversial studies, like the research about vaccines causing autism, have since been discredited. It\u2019s important to look to health professionals as you research and learn about vaccinations and how they can benefit your family.", "611a435c3f45b6c288196363"], ["REFUTES", "fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines", "COVID-19 Vaccines Authorized for Emergency Use\nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine\nModerna COVID-19 Vaccine\nJanssen COVID-19 Vaccine", "5ec3aed5c18fa401ec231e7d"], ["NOT ENOUGH INFO", NaN, NaN, "6125f32da0a5e7e607d78376"]], "label": "REFUTES"}

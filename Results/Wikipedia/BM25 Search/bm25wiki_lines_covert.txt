   Many of the covid vaccines are more likely to cause side effects compared to your normal flu shot. Here is the data for 1st and 2nd doses.   Side effects don't mean it's bad for you. It means it's working. That's how the immune system works.  Source:  https://t.co/hFv7q9slPh https://t.co/2LjZ6lXmrV [SEP] Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Typical side effects are stronger and more common in younger people and in subsequent doses, and up to 20% of people report a disruptive level of side effects after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Side effects
All vaccines can have minor side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the introduction of a foreign substance into the body. 
 The S1 spike protein used in the Covid vaccine may be toxic to endothelial cells. Likely the cause of the clotting problems we are seeing from people who get the vaccine.  https://t.co/ZCepuEfWCD [SEP] It shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone can cause vascular disease and could explain some covid-19 patients who suffered from strokes, or other vascular problems in other parts of human body at the same time. Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection, since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Endothelium in Covid-19
In April 2020, the presence of viral elements in endothelial cells of 3 patients who had died of COVID-19 was reported for the first time. 
  And the Covid vaccine can’t knock out all the variants either.   So once again, we are taking a vaccine with known risks that STILL doesn’t let us leave our basements or take off our double masks. But it does cause blood clots, so there’s that. [SEP] According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. Nasal vaccines have been approved for influenza, but not for COVID-19. Available evidence indicates that the level of protection may not be the same for all variants of the virus.As of December 2021, there are no FDA-authorized or approved tests that providers or the public can use to determine if a person is protected from infection reliably.As of March 2022, elderly residents' protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death in English care homes was high immediately after vaccination, but protection declined significantly in the months following vaccination. According to the EMA "the benefits of Comirnaty in preventing COVID‑19 continue to outweigh any risks, and there are no recommended changes regarding the use of this vaccine." According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.

4. Vaccines have other heavy metals along with nano particles that are excellent conductors for frequencies being beamed down. The reason chronically ill have most covid deaths b/c severe Gut damage is cause of most chronic illness, allowing particles into blood stream... [SEP] Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Nevertheless, vaccines are thought to provide protection against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to Omicron. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. 
 People literally believe that the world is flat, 5G networks caused covid and that vaccines cause autism. This is par for the course… [SEP] However, by the time that scientists had shown the narrative to be false, it had become part of the lay understanding of autism. Without direct informed knowledge of autism, a complex disorder, members of the public are easily influenced by rumors and misinformation presented in the mass media and repeated on social media and the internet.These misinformed beliefs persist even when contradicted by scientific evidence. Folk epidemiology persists because people seek, receive, and preferentially believe information that is consistent with their existing views; misjudge the reliability of their sources of information, and are misled by anecdotal evidence; and tend not to revise their opinions even when their original sources of information are shown to be wrong. So it's an absolute lie that has killed thousands of kids. Because the mothers who heard that lie, many of them didn't have their kids take either pertussis or measles vaccine, and their children are dead today. And so the people who go and engage in those anti-vaccine efforts—you know, they, they kill children. Furthermore, scientific studies have consistently refuted a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism.Despite this, some parents believe that vaccinations cause autism; they therefore delay or avoid immunizing their children (for example, under the "vaccine overload" hypothesis that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm a child's immune system and lead to autism, even though this hypothesis has no scientific evidence and is biologically implausible). The combination of broader criteria, increased awareness, and potentially increasing actual prevalence, has led to a trend of steadily increasing estimates of autism prevalence, causing a misconception that there is an autism epidemic and perpetuating the myth that it is caused by vaccines.Psychiatry has traditionally classified autism as a mental disorder, and the autism rights movement and a small but increasing number of researchers see autism as part of neurodiversity, the natural diversity in human thinking and experience, with strengths, differences, and weaknesses.

Know the facts! There is no evidence that #COVID19 #vaccines cause #infertility, says   &  https://t.co/c1u4QONH4b #NIAW2021 #InfertilityAwareness [SEP] On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS. There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. 
  So, they die from lung failure caused by extreme pneumonia or heart failure from sludgy blood but the root cause is #COVID19 (which can be confirmed post-mortem) so the death is counted as due to the #coronavirus & NOT due to “natural” causes of pneumonia or heart attack ... /3 [SEP] Nevertheless, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death in developing countries, and also among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also result in pneumonia. Pneumonia is the most common hospital-acquired infection that causes death. : 3612  Heart failure is the potential end stage of all heart diseases.Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. Without urgent treatment, these events result in sudden death. High blood pressure accounts for most cardiovascular deaths. It can be simplistically described as a failure of the pump function of the heart. In general, this is caused by dysfunction or destruction of cardiac myocytes or their molecular components. 
“It’s unclear if his death was related to the virus.” This is why we perform autopsies. There is a significant likelihood that #COVID19 played a role in that it is known to affect endothelial cells & has been shown to cause neurological symptoms including stroke. https://t.co/FeaX5KMPC4 [SEP] In most cases, a medical examiner or coroner can determine the cause of death. Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Testing of prior samples revealed a person who was infected in France on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. 
  COVID infection can cause a huge drop in sperm counts and infertility. The vaccine has not been associated with this. Vaccine safer than COVID for make fertility. [SEP] A 2021 review also supported selenium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10 or carnitines, but warned that "excessive use of antioxidants may be detrimental to the spermatic function and many of the over-the-counter supplements are not scientifically proven to improve fertility. A review provided evidence that taking dehydroepiandrosterone before starting an in vitro fertilization series may increase pregnancy rates and decrease miscarriage likelihood. 2 April
Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine report the creation of a promising possible COVID-19 vaccine, named PittCoVacc, against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and are hoping for a fast approval track, lasting less than the usual year of testing, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Their study may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design and shows that the protein's coating is relatively weak and that the spike protein may be relatively vulnerable to antibodies. Researchers report a temporary 17% drop in daily global CO2 emissions by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels during the COVID-19 forced confinements. Scientists report that a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found evidence that the drug hydroxychloroquine, controversially promoted by President of the United States Donald Trump as a potential treatment in mid-March, does not effectively protect people from COVID-19 administered within 4 days after exposure. 16 June
The University of Oxford reports that a major trial of dexamethasone – a cheap, widely available corticosteroid medication – shows it can significantly reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Scientists report simulation results that indicate that flushing a toilet can create a large, widespread cloud of aerosol droplets containing viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 that lasts long enough for the droplets to be breathed in by others and offer suggestions concerning safer toilet use and recommendations for a better toilet design. 
 Severe Covid is a systemic disease not just confined to resp system.. causes hyper inflammation,clotting, encephalopathy etc..we need all hands on deck from generalists to specialists, nurses, ward attendants [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease.A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). National Guidance for post-COVID syndrome assessment clinics (Report). Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to intensive care units (ICU).Between 5% and 50% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID, a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease. 
Immunologist warns Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s  https://t.co/e41d3OssWU [SEP] Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. In August 2018, Pfizer signed an agreement with BioNTech to conduct joint research and development activities regarding mRNA-based influenza vaccines. They said that people with very short life expectancies have little to gain from vaccination, having a real risk of adverse reactions in the last days of life and of dying earlier.A 2021 report by the New South Wales Government (NSW Health) in Australia found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe for those with various forms of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, though it does note that the data on said groups is limited, due to their exclusion from many of the vaccine earlier trials held in 2020. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. Pfizer and BioNTech announced on 18 February 2021 that the first participants received their first dose in this trial.A study published in March 2021, in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology came to the conclusion that messenger RNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were safe and effective at providing immunity against infection to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.

Virology
Middle East respiratory syndrome is caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a species with single-stranded RNA belonging to the genus betacoronavirus which is distinct from SARS coronavirus and the common-cold coronavirus. Prevention
While the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):
Wear a medical mask
Wear eye protection (i.e. The CDC placed the travel health alert to level 2, which calls for taking enhanced precautions.In May 2019, 14 cases of MERS were reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) by Saudi authorities, of which five were fatal. Kenya

   Covid causes myocarditis much more frequently than a vaccine. [SEP] Between December 2020 and May 2021, there were 55 cases of myocarditis per 1 million people vaccinated, 95% of which were classified as mild and most spent no more than four days in the hospital. Since April 2021, increasing number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States in about 13 per 1 million young people, mostly male and over the age of 16, after vaccination with the Pfizer–BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine. A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. A study published in JAMA showed an increased risk for myocarditis within seven days of vaccination. There is a rare risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane covering the heart) after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). The risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination is estimated to be 0.3 to 5 cases per 100,000 persons with the highest risk in young males. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination.

In February 2021, Twitter removed accounts in India that criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for its conduct during Indian farmers' protests in 2020–2021.At the start of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, numerous tweets reported false medical information related to the pandemic. To counter extreme trauma, such as exposure to the poisonous fungus in The Seeds of Death and after being shot in Spearhead from Space, the Doctor can go into a self-induced coma until they recover. The Eighth Doctor comments at one point in the television movie that the anaesthesia interfered with the regenerative process and that he had been "dead too long", accounting for his initial amnesia. A common side effect the Doctor frequently experiences is a period of instability and partial amnesia following regeneration. The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia due to the anaesthetics affecting his physiology (1996 Doctor Who television film). After crash-landing the TARDIS, the Doctor collapsed and remained unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours ("The Christmas Invasion"). The experience was traumatic enough to cause one of his hearts to temporarily stop beating. 
   Hypercapnia is a condition that can be easily corrected by your own body, or presents over days/hours due to underlying issues with your lungs caused by things like smoking damage, morbid obesity or - guess what - Covid 19.[NEWLINE]You can avoid Hyoercapnia by using a face covering. [SEP] Hypercapnia (from the Greek hyper = "above" or "too much" and kapnos = "smoke"), also known as hypercarbia and CO2 retention, is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. Acute hypercapnia is called acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) and is a medical emergency as it generally occurs in the context of acute illness. Hypercapnia is a hazard of underwater diving associated with breath-hold diving, scuba diving, particularly on rebreathers, and deep diving where it is associated with increased breathing gas density due to the high ambient pressure. Hypercapnia also occurs when the breathing gas is contaminated with carbon dioxide, or respiratory gas exchange cannot keep up with the metabolic production of carbon dioxide, which can occur when gas density limits ventilation at high ambient pressures.In severe hypercapnia (generally

 Out of the 3,000,000+ doses that were administered, 6 women got blood clots.  There are lots of medicines that cause this very rare side effect, and being vaccinated against COVID should be worth the risk. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated [SEP] Blood clots
Videos posted to Facebook and Instagram have claimed without evidence that 62 percent of people given an mRNA vaccine develop blood clots, and that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine causes blood to clot "in a minute or two". A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. In April, EMA found a possible link between the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low platelet counts, although it said its benefits far outweighed the risks and did not announce any restrictions. A University of Oxford study concludes that although the AstraZeneca vaccine raises the risk of blood clots and another condition that causes severe bleeding, the risk of these effects is much greater from COVID. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issues a statement saying there is no evidence linking the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine to an increased risk of blood clots, and urges people to continue being vaccinated. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it has found 30 cases of rare blood clots that developed in people after they had the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, but that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. 3 April
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency confirms seven blood clot deaths among the 18 million people who have been vaccinated with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, but it is unclear whether the deaths are a side-effect of the vaccine. A total of 79 cases of rare blood clots have been found in patients who have received the Oxford vaccine, of which 19 people have died. 
With the uncertainties associated with #COVID, many people have turned to food as a coping mechanism. Eating due to boredom or stress may provide temporary satisfaction. However, over time, this can cause weight gain and emotional distress.

An increase of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic is a commonly held perception worldwide. Many young people struggled with boredom, fear, and sleep problems.A collection of 29 studies posted in August 2021 by Jamanetwork showed that the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety had doubled during COVID-19. Specifically, researchers saw an increase in the amount of eating disorders related vulnerabilities. There was an increase of 10% of student's perception of their body and the description of their weight as a risk factor for acquiring an eating disorder and exhibiting symptoms during the months between January 2020 and April 2020. COVID-19's physical and emotional burden impacted healthcare workers increased rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout that impacted sleep, quality work/empathy towards patients, and suicide rates.Cases of anxiety and depression within healthcare workers who interact with COVID-19 patients increased by 1.57% and 1.52% respectively.One study reported that frontline nurses experience higher rates of anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.A cross-sectional study using an online survey in Southern California examined stress levels before and during the pandemic. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19.It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity, complications of diabetes, anxiety disorders, and the total number of conditions.During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it was  not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested. 
  The vaccine has a higher survival rate yet conspiracy nutjobs freak out about that. See how it's disingenuous to focus only on survival rate? You're ignoring those critically ill - which included Boris in ICU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignore death statistics, look up the damage covid causes your body. https://t.co/1yTsjreJfm [SEP] As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent. See: "The History of Vaccines". According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. A study is investigating the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 provided by the mRNA vaccines. The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID‑19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.Authorized vaccines of this type are the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, the Sputnik V COVID‑19 vaccine, Convidecia, and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine.Convidecia and Janssen are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.Sputnik V uses Ad26 for its first dose, which is the same as Janssen's only dose, and Ad5 for the second dose, which is the same as Convidecia's only dose.In August 2021, the developers of Sputnik V proposed, in view of the Delta case surge, that Pfizer test the Ad26 component (termed its 'Light' version) as a booster shot. In March 2021, Brazilian journalism agency Agência Pública reported that the country vaccinated about twice as many people who declare themselves white than black and noted that mortality from COVID‑19 is higher in the black population.In May 2021, UNICEF made an urgent appeal to industrialized nations to pool their excess COVID‑19 vaccine capacity to make up for a 125-million-dose gap in the COVAX program.

Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/CeJM6NoGhQ [SEP] Dementia is associated with a reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing nursing home care. These symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.The life expectancy of people with PD is reduced. At sufficiently high doses, nicotine may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradyarrhythmia, and possibly seizures, hypoventilation, and death. At sufficiently high doses, somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness), confusion, syncope (loss of consciousness from fainting), shortness of breath, marked weakness, seizures, and coma may occur. It can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, and cause issues with a person's sleeping habits, eating habits, and general health. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. 
  And to be clear I'm NOT trying to say that *only* the vaccine could cause an ADE issue in the future. Antibodies from surviving Covid-19 could potentially trigger the same problem. But what is impossible to know at this point is if the vaccine boosted antibody response could [SEP] In some cases vaccines may result in partial immune protection (in which immunity is less than 100% effective but still reduces risk of infection) or in temporary immune protection (in which immunity wanes over time) rather than full or permanent immunity.

Adjuvants
Vaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. An immunological adjuvant is a substance formulated with a vaccine to elevate the immune response to an antigen, such as the COVID‑19 virus or influenza virus. Specifically, an adjuvant may be used in formulating a COVID‑19 vaccine candidate to boost its immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent COVID‑19 infection in vaccinated individuals. Vaccine adjustments
Effectiveness against transmission
As of 2022, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can transmit infection in household settings. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca).

Touch! Neural processing of social touch
The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. Affective touch is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex and is processed in a similar way to emotions invoked by sight and sound, as exemplified by the increase of adrenaline caused by the social touch of a loved one, as opposed to the physical inability to touch someone you do not love. It was found that the affectionate touch has distinct target areas on the body, different associated affect, comfort-value, and expression frequency based on the type of touch action that is performed. Besides the rather obvious sensory consequences of touch, it can also affect higher-level aspects of cognition such as social judgements and decision-making. Touching may refer to:

The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccines works by effectively revving up the immune system to fight off the virus that causes the disease. But what if that same approach could be used to turn the immune system down to treat autoimmune disorders? https://t.co/YK3Rxfzed5 [NEWLINE]#mRNA [SEP] Trends
Since at least 2013, scientists have been trying to develop synthetic third-generation vaccines by reconstructing the outside structure of a virus; it was hoped that this will help prevent vaccine resistance.Principles that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. Autologous
Aivita Biomedical is developing an experimental autologous dendritic cell COVID‑19 vaccine kit where the vaccine is prepared and incubated at the point-of-care using cells from the intended recipient. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. Manipulation in medicine
The immune response can be manipulated to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant rejection, and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system (see immunization) or cancer. 
 I have APS, the syndrome which develops with both vaccine and covid to cause clots, had AZ with no ill effects but I'm anticoagulated. Those who aren't and then have other risk factors like OCP could be the ones developing these complications. It's just a blood test, easily done. [SEP] Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. These include soreness, redness, rash, and inflammation at the injection site. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca).

Maybe start there Do we have any scientist in Canada.Fungal respiratory infections kill millions, cause cancer, blindness NoBody cares https://t.co/eFqlGSkExt [SEP] A September 2020 review journal article said, "The possibility that the COVID‑19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence," including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.As of 1 October 2021, Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.As of December 2020, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 22 June 2023, the pandemic had caused 768,186,332 cases and 6,945,701 confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest pandemics in history. Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.In May 2022, the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14.9 million compared to 5.4 million reported COVID-19 deaths, with the majority of the unreported 9.5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus, rather than indirect deaths. On 20 December 2022, the Chinese State Council narrowed its definition of what would be counted as a COVID-19 death to include solely respiratory failure, which led to skepticism by health experts of the government's total death count at a time when hospitals reported being overwhelmed with cases following the abrupt discontinuation of zero-COVID.The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. See also

    Not to mention the lasting damage covid has on a person, we’re still finding out that covid can cause life changing issues, fibrosis, COPD, Diabetes, CKD, brain tissue death, to name a few these are in relatively Healthy people [SEP] Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects." An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. Prognosis
The severity of COVID-19 varies. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. 
•In Africa, malaria has caused approximately four times as many deaths as COVID-19 over the past year.[NEWLINE]•Scientists are trialling a malaria vaccine which prevents the disease 77% of the time among those receiving it - a landmark which has never been reached before. [SEP] As of 2020, there is one vaccine which has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa. Efforts at decreasing the disease in Africa since 2000 have been partially effective, with rates of the disease dropping by an estimated forty percent on the continent.Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.In total, malaria may have killed 50-60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived. In November 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication's long-term goal.In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030, and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040. Only one malaria vaccine is licensed for use, and it shows relatively low effectiveness, while several other vaccine candidates in clinical trials aim to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of malaria transmission. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization's Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy. The study found that, on average, regions where malaria is endemic reported lower COVID-19 case fatality rates compared to regions without endemic malaria. Malaria causes about 400–900 million cases of fever and 1–3M deaths annually. 
  No but keep in mind they also believe the world is flat and that 5G causes covid and vaccines cause infertility & autism 😒 [SEP] Autism
The idea of a link between vaccines and autism has been extensively investigated and conclusively shown to be false. The scientific consensus is that there is no relationship, causal or otherwise, between vaccines and incidence of autism, and vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.Nevertheless, the anti-vaccination movement continues to promote myths, conspiracy theories, and misinformation linking the two. The Muslim Council of Britain argued against the use of intranasal influenza vaccine in 2019 due to the presence of gelatin in the vaccine and consider such vaccines to be non-halal (unclean).In India, in 2018, a three-minute doctored clip circulated among Muslims claiming that the MR-VAC vaccine against measles and rubella was a "Modi government-RSS conspiracy" to stop the population growth of Muslims. While belief in conspiracy theories is not a new phenomenon, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this can lead to adverse health effects. 5G mobile-phone networks
The first conspiracy theories purporting a link between COVID-19 and 5G mobile networks had already appeared by the end of January 2020. The claims were criticized on social media and debunked by Reuters, USA Today, Full Fact and American Public Health Association executive director Georges C. Benjamin.Cowan's claims were repeated by Mark Steele, a conspiracy theorist who claimed to have first-hand knowledge that 5G was in fact a weapon system capable of causing symptoms identical to those produced by the virus. After the arson attacks, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the theory that COVID-19 virus may be spread by 5G wireless communication is "just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well". A widely circulated video showed a woman accusing employees of broadband company Community Fibre of installing 5G as part of a plan to kill the population.Of those who believed that 5G networks caused COVID-19 symptoms, 60% stated that much of their knowledge about the virus came from YouTube.

Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. Viral vector vaccines were also developed for the COVID‑19 pandemic after the technology was previously cleared for Ebola.As multiple COVID‑19 vaccines have been authorized or licensed for use, real-world vaccine effectiveness (RWE) is being assessed using case control and observational studies. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation, and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. 
   It is very rare in the context of the vaccine and myocarditis in general. Vaccines cause side effects, they wouldn’t work otherwise. It’s simply just a reaction to your body making antibodies and C-Reactive Protein. And compared to actually getting covid, it’s not that bad. [SEP] Between December 2020 and May 2021, there were 55 cases of myocarditis per 1 million people vaccinated, 95% of which were classified as mild and most spent no more than four days in the hospital. Since April 2021, increasing number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States in about 13 per 1 million young people, mostly male and over the age of 16, after vaccination with the Pfizer–BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. There is a rare risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane covering the heart) after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). The risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination is estimated to be 0.3 to 5 cases per 100,000 persons with the highest risk in young males. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. The incidence rate for local adverse erythema is about 10.8%, in 1.9% of cases redness may extend to a size of 100 mm or greater.In June 2021, the US CDC confirmed that myocarditis or pericarditis occurs in about 13 of every 1 million young people, mostly male and over the age of 16, who received the Moderna or the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine.

According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection.

[SEP] According to a 2014 review in The New England Journal of Medicine, tobacco smoking will kill about 1 billion people in the 21st century if current smoking patterns persist, half of them before the age of 70.China has the largest tobacco smoking population, followed by India. Brain and spinal cord injury
Stroke and traumatic brain injury lead to cell death, characterized by a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes within the brain. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal. While the toxicity and lethality of THC in children is not known, they are at risk for encephalopathy, hypotension, respiratory depression severe enough to require ventilation, somnolence and coma. The risk of early death is anticipated to be similar to that of smokeless tobacco. Rare serious effects included coma, seizure, trouble breathing, and heart attack. The highest-doses can lead to coma. Vaping is potentially harmful, especially to the critically ill, such as people with oncologic, lung, or cardiac diseases. 
    covid vaccine doesn't cause fertility issues, or any of the things you mentioned  https://t.co/unEXqNzugT [SEP] As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes artificial insemination regardless of whether it is homologous (from the husband) or heterologous (from a donor) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love and conjugal act between a husband and wife. Due to the anti-abortion stance, some Catholics oppose receiving vaccines derived from fetal cells obtained via abortion. On 21 December 2020, and regarding COVID-19 vaccination, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith emitted a document stating that "it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process" when no alternative vaccine is available, since "the moral duty to avoid such passive material cooperation is not obligatory if there is a grave danger, such as the otherwise uncontainable spread of a serious pathological agent." The document states that receiving the vaccine does not constitute endorsement of the practice of abortion, and that "the morality of vaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one's own health, but also on the duty to pursue the common good." The document cautions further:Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent. In particular, they must avoid any risk to the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable. Vaccinations
The Episcopal Church "recognizes no claim of theological or religious exemption from vaccination for our members and reiterates the spirit of General Convention policies that Episcopalians should seek the counsel of experienced medical professionals, scientific research, and epidemiological evidence," while similarly condemning the "spreading of fraudulent research that suggested vaccines might cause harm." The Episcopal Church has endorsed stronger government mandates for vaccinations and has characterized the choice to be inoculated as "a duty not only to our own selves and families but to our communities," while describing the choice to not vaccinate, when it is medically safe to do so, as a decision which "threatens the lives of others." 
    I never said Covid-19 wasn’t a real coronavirus.  And deaths linked to Covid-19 are primarily caused directly from pneumonia, or flu-like symptoms.  The classifications for influenza and pneumonia reporting changed when Covid-19 appeared.  Facts. [SEP] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also result in pneumonia. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is sometimes referred to as the "coronavirus pandemic" despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. The model attributed 148,000–249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.The COVID-19 pandemic is not caused by an influenza virus but SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus which also primarily affects the respiratory system. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.The U.S. experienced 882,000 "excess deaths" (i.e., deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years) between February 2020 and January 2022, which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID-19 during that period (835,000 deaths). The article also suggested that deaths attributed to cardiac and respiratory diseases in infected persons were incorrectly categorized as deaths due to COVID-19. 
COVID vaccine is likely to cause infertility issues through an autoimmune disorder that affects placenta development. What a wonderful coincidence that vaccines tend to cause autoimmune disorders, even a new experimental one. Btw, autism is being found to be an autoimmune issue. https://t.co/7hzF1xKybH [SEP] Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. Economics
Vaccine inequity damages the global economy, disrupting the global supply chain. Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility. Analysis of large cohort data shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) is linked to a substantially increased risk of developing a diverse new-onset autoimmune diseases. 
  All of these people are missing the long term unknown risks of covid infection. Epstein Barr Virus is a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, hep B & C cause liver cancer. 15% of cancers are viral! And people don’t want to risk vaccines???? [SEP] In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infection
Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases. Oncoviruses (viruses that can cause cancer) include human papillomavirus (cervical cancer), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma) and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias). In 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths – or ~4.5 M deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years – were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI, according to a GBD systematic analysis. Vaccination
Vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses. Human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer. Possible harms from follow-up procedures

 Sorry[NEWLINE]Dexamethasone can cause blood clots, will help #COVID19 [NEWLINE]Try Tadalfil instead, it helps lungs, reduces inflammation and clotting[NEWLINE]Forget purpose of medicine, we need results [SEP] Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, superior vena cava syndrome (a complication of some forms of cancer), and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. Medical uses
Anti-inflammatory
Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. COVID-19
Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for people with COVID-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation).The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for people with severe COVID-19, defined as people with SpO2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although dexamethasone, and other glucocorticoids, reduce mortality in COVID-19 they have also been associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, secondary infections being a significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients.The mechanism of action of dexamethasone involves suppression of late-stage interferon type I programs in severe COVID-19 patients. High-altitude illnesses
Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It was introduced for medical use in 1958.On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. The final report was published in February 2021.The World Health Organization (WHO) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving COVID-19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the WHO Director-General stated that "WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. 
  The viruses that cause flu are not the same species as COVID-19, please do not mix them up. Also, HPV does not cause flu, but its long term infection does lead to cancer. What NPR is saying is that long term COVID-19 infection may also lead to serious damage. [SEP] Some viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy, while others, such as papillomaviruses, are established causes of cancer. Hepadnaviruses)

Role in human disease
Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Infections with the virus caused the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. Cancer
Viruses are an established cause of cancer in humans and other species. Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID.Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. 
If someone tells you the vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage. [SEP] Reproductive health
In a December 2020 petition to the European Medicines Agency, German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and British researcher Michael Yeadon suggested, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines could cause infertility in women by targeting the syncytin-1 protein necessary for placenta formation. A study conducted on 44 rats injected with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at doses over 300 times the human dose by body weight and 44 rats injected with placebo found no statistically significant evidence of any adverse effects on the fertility of female rats or on the health of the offspring of rats (the 3% lower pregnancy rate found in the vaccine group was not statistically significant). Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States "can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy". The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contained tissue from aborted fetuses. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. 
 3) Plus the death rate isn't the full story.  COVID-18 causes vascular damage.  This can result in secondary strokes, loss or reduction of various senses, cardiac problems, and one or more of those conditions which "immuno-compromise" one. [SEP] They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. It is a type of coagulative necrosis that occurs because the radiation directly or indirectly damages blood vessels in the area, which reduces the blood supply to the remaining healthy tissue, causing it to die by ischemia, similar to what happens in an ischemic stroke. CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). Other CVDs include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory. As infectious diseases have become less lethal, and the most common causes of death in developed countries are now tumors and cardiovascular diseases, these conditions have received increased attention in medical research. A mutated strain of SARS would go on to develop into COVID-19, causing the future COVID-19 pandemic. 
  The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA. Classen says mRNA vaccines may cause Alzheimer's, ALS, and Prion disease. He provides no evidence for these claims. He doesn't provide proof because there is none. [SEP] Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. RNA
An mRNA vaccine (or RNA vaccine) is a novel type of vaccine which is composed of the nucleic acid RNA, packaged within a vector such as lipid nanoparticles. A study is investigating the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 provided by the mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. When introduced into human tissue, the vaccine contains either self-replicating RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), which both cause cells to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Examples include a vaccine candidate which uses a modified avian virus as a vector to target SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and an mRNA vaccine delivered via a nasal nanoparticle spray. Typical side effects are stronger and more common in younger people and in subsequent doses, and up to 20% of people report a disruptive level of side effects after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine.

[NEWLINE]#coronavirus #covid #corona #staysafe #socialdistancing#pandemic #virus https://t.co/efc4wI6LUR [SEP] In practice, the term usually refers to the diagnostic identification of antibodies in the serum. Serological tests
Serological tests are diagnostic methods that are used to identify antibodies and antigens in a patient's sample. Serological tests may be performed to diagnose infections and autoimmune illnesses, to check if a person has immunity to certain diseases, and in many other situations, such as determining an individual's blood type. Applications
Microbiology
In microbiology, serologic tests are used to determine if a person has antibodies against a specific pathogen, or to detect antigens associated with a pathogen in a person's sample. Serologic tests are especially useful for organisms that are difficult to culture by routine laboratory methods, like Treponema pallidum (the causative agent of syphilis), or viruses.The presence of antibodies against a pathogen in a person's blood indicates that they have been exposed to that pathogen. Most serologic tests measure one of two types of antibodies: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay.

The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.In January 2018, scientists reported that 800 million viruses, mainly of marine origin, are deposited daily from the Earth's atmosphere onto every square meter of the planet's surface, as the result of a global atmospheric stream of viruses, circulating above the weather system but below the altitude of usual airline travel, distributing viruses around the planet.Like any organism, marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections.

History
In November 2021, the full nucleotide sequences of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were released by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, in response to a freedom of information request. Some nations involved in long-standing territorial disputes have reportedly had their access to vaccines blocked by competing nations; Palestine has accused Israel of blocking vaccine delivery to Gaza, while Taiwan has suggested that China has hampered its efforts to procure vaccine doses.A single dose of the COVID‑19 vaccines by AstraZeneca would cost 47 Egyptian pounds (EGP), and the authorities are selling it between 100 and 200 EGP. The program mostly relied on the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India, which faced serious supply problems due to increased domestic vaccine needs in India from March to June 2021. In mid-May 2021, UNICEF was also critical of the fact that most proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early in 2022.In July 2021, the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization said in a joint statement: "As many countries are struggling with new variants, and a third wave of COVID‑19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth. In July 2021, The BMJ reported that countries have thrown out over 250,000 vaccine doses as supply exceeded demand and strict laws prevented the sharing of vaccines. External links

 The immune response to COVID can kill (see cytokine storm and note that both the virus and the vaccine can cause clotting) so why are we deliberately creating immune responses with vaccinations? The vaccine is just another way that people can initiate the deadly immune response [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Specifically, an adjuvant may be used in formulating a COVID‑19 vaccine candidate to boost its immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent COVID‑19 infection in vaccinated individuals. The principle behind immunization is to introduce an antigen, derived from a disease-causing organism, that stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against that organism, but that does not itself cause the pathogenic effects of that organism. Vaccines
A COVID-19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID-19.As of March 2023, more than 5.5 billion people had received one or more doses (11.8 billion in total) in over 197 countries. 
Cytokine storms occur when the body’s immune system attacks itself, and has been noted as a leading cause of death in patients suffering infected with #Covid-19.  https://t.co/pfmd08gNtA [SEP] A cytokine storm, also called hypercytokinemia, is a physiological reaction in humans and other animals in which the innate immune system causes an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines. Normally, cytokines are part of the body's immune response to infection, but their sudden release in large quantities can cause multisystem organ failure and death.Cytokine storms can be caused by a number of infectious and non-infectious etiologies, especially viral respiratory infections such as H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well. Relationship to COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors have attributed many deaths to cytokine storms. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storms are also suspected to be the main cause of death in the 1918 "Spanish Flu" pandemic. In the COVID-19 pandemic, some deaths from COVID-19 have been attributable to cytokine release storms. Current data suggest cytokine storms may be the source of extensive lung tissue damage and dysfunctional coagulation in COVID-19 infections. 
How the vaccine works: The Pfizer/BioTech COVID-19 vaccine contains the Messenger RNA which is packaged in a lipid envelop that allows the messenger RNA to enter the cells. This will cause the cells to produce the COVID-19 cell protein. When the protein is released from the cells [SEP] Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, viral proteins (antigens), or RNA. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.This is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human host cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.After HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.Coronaviruses can enter cells by either fusing to their lipid envelope with the cell membrane on the cell surface or by internalization via endocytosis. Genome translation
On entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm. 
Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the USA, more Americans are dying with Covid-19 than Ischemic heart disease, Lung cancer, or COPD! We need Herd immunity from 70-80% of the population vaccinated! [SEP] Causes
The leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease. Tobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people worldwide in the 21st century, a World Health Organization report warned.Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. Of all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day. According to CDC data, mortality rates among children and adolescents increased by 20% from 2019 to 2021.In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic collisions caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal health care, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance. Black boys and men age 15–44 are the only race/sex category for which homicide is a top-five cause of death.In December 2020, African Americans were less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to mistrust in the U.S. medical system related to decades of abuses and anti-black treatment. From 2021 to 2022, there was an increase in African Americans who became vaccinated. Still, in 2022, COVID-19 complications became the third leading cause of death for African Americans. 
In some cases, long Covid could mean lifelong Covid = lung damage, heart damage and brain damage that can cause memory loss and brain fog, kidney damage, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, loss of taste and smell, anxiety, depression and, above all, fatigue. https://t.co/cZfcObJGOA [SEP] The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath. They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Longer-term effects
Some early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. This damage can cause long term effects such as but not limited to; memory loss, confusion, and loss of cognitive function. 
  Covid just became the 6th leading cause of death in ohio. Is there a reason we aren't trying to stop Heart disease? [SEP] COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital." Ohio: The state has 564 confirmed COVID-19 cases: 145 hospitalizations and 8 deaths. March 27
Ohio: 1,137 people in Ohio have the virus, with 276 needing hospitalization. March 30
Ohio: Ohio has 1,933 cases of COVID-19, including 475 that resulted in hospitalization and 39 that resulted in death. Ohio: There are 7,280 cases of COVID-19, including 2,156 that resulted in hospitalizations and 324 that resulted in death. The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Ohio on March 9, 2020, when the state's first cases were reported. By December 12, a total of 553,461 cases had been reported leading to 31,803 hospitalizations and 7,477 deaths.As of June 15, 2023, Ohio has administered at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine to 7,590,235 people, or 64.93% of the population, completed vaccination for 7,040,407 people, or 60.23% of the population, and administered first booster to 4,006,103 people, second booster doses to 1,822,372 people, and updated boosters to 1,890,682 people, or 16.17% of the population. 
Animals and #COVID19[NEWLINE]The virus that causes COVID-19 is different than other coronaviruses that affect domestic animals. Learn how to keep pets and livestock, as well as yourself, safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/jTwdvBhDPM [SEP] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species.Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ≈34%). Vaccines
A COVID-19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. Animal viruses
Viruses are important pathogens of livestock. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. 
   What do you consider minute? 3%?[NEWLINE]Then there's long covid that can include fatigue, lung damage, heart damage, secondary infection, thrombosis and nerve damage.[NEWLINE]All can cause severe after effects and in some cases, death after the 28 day cut off for reporting covid deaths. [SEP] Classification
By effect
Overall life effect
Fatigue can have significant negative impacts on quality of life. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, directed attention fatigue, or disengagement. Viral infection is a significant risk factor for CFS, with one study finding 22% of people with EBV experience fatigue six months later, and 9% having strictly defined CFS. A systematic review found that fatigue severity was the main predictor of prognosis in CFS, and did not identify psychological factors linked to prognosis. A review of long COVID research found half of those affected met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.Another review found that risk factors for developing CFS after mononucleosis, dengue fever, or Q-fever included longer bed-rest during the illness, poorer pre-illness physical fitness, attributing symptoms to physical illness, belief that a long recovery time is needed, as well as pre-infection distress and fatigue. The 2003 Canadian consensus criteria state: "A patient with ME/CFS will meet the criteria for fatigue, post-exertional malaise and/or fatigue, sleep dysfunction, and pain; have two or more neurological/cognitive manifestations and one or more symptoms from two of the categories of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune manifestations; and the illness persists for at least 6 months". It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. 
Researchers believe that the inflammation may lead to heart failure.- German Study[NEWLINE]COVID-19 may increase the risk of blood clots, which may cause heart damage or heart attacks in some people. [SEP] Comorbidities
It is firmly established that systemic markers for inflammation predict coronary heart disease complications with or without existing heart disease. In severe cases, COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm which contributes to excessive and uncontrolled inflammation of organs, particularly respiratory tissues. If untreated, this increased inflammation can result in reduced immune response, pneumonia, lymphoid tissue damage, and death. Individuals with abnormal cytokine production, such as those with obesity or systemic chronic inflammation, have poorer health outcomes from COVID-19. In this case a clot or thrombus can form, blocking the artery, and restricting blood flow to an area of heart muscle causing a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) or unstable angina. Heart failure is the result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or high blood pressure. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias. Many cardiomyopathies can lead to heart failure in the later stages of the disease. 
Need encouragement to get the vaccine, or know someone who does? CCNY  student Clarence Kong explains how the vaccines work and exactly why they cannot cause COVID-19 infection. #VaxUpCUNY #VaccinesSaveLives https://t.co/1JvDAZgRhP [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19. Vaccine adjustments
Effectiveness against transmission
As of 2022, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can transmit infection in household settings. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. Organizations such as the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network could help to support the production of such vaccines in developing countries, with lower production costs and greater ease of deployment.While vaccines substantially reduce the probability and severity of infection, it is still possible for fully vaccinated people to contract and spread COVID‑19.

  Are you aware that the vaccines could cause miscarriage? The real data regarding covid is that there are tiny numbers, percentage wise, of generally healthy people under the age of 60 that die from COVID or that get admitted into ICU. Are you worried about cancer too? https://t.co/gFOUxRcWTW [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
 I think systemically injecting spike protein causes an exaggerated immune response that is identical 2systemic COVID infection in frail elderly. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The immune response does the damage only this time because it’s injected systemically bypassing the innate system we see ICU & death. [SEP] For this reason the spike protein has been the focus of development for COVID-19 vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Most COVID-19 vaccine development efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic aim to activate the immune system against the spike protein. Function
The spike protein is responsible for viral entry into the host cell, a required early step in viral replication. Due to the outbreak of SARS and the COVID-19 pandemic, antibodies to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have been extensively studied. Building on techniques previously used in vaccine research aimed at respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV, many SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts have used constructs that include mutations to stabilize the spike protein's pre-fusion conformation, facilitating development of antibodies against epitopes exposed in this conformation.According to a study published in January 2023, markedly elevated levels of full-length spike protein unbound by antibodies were found in people who developed postvaccine myocarditis (vs. controls that remained healthy). It shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone can cause vascular disease and could explain some covid-19 patients who suffered from strokes, or other vascular problems in other parts of human body at the same time. Spike proteins were also said to be "shed" by vaccinated people, in an erroneous allusion to the phenomenon of vaccine-induced viral shedding, which is a rare effect of live-virus vaccines unlike those used for COVID-19. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies. 
 in addition to that,  covid is viral in nature — no antibiotic can ever kill viral pathogens.  antibiotics are used if there is a bacterial cause and not viral cause.  i hope i made that clear. [SEP] This can lead to unnecessary antimicrobial use, a pattern which may have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.Studies have shown that common misconceptions about the effectiveness and necessity of antibiotics to treat common mild illnesses contribute to their overuse. Pandemics, disinfectants and healthcare systems
Increased antibiotic use during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate this global health challenge. Since the beginning of the antimicrobial era, antimicrobials have been used to treat a wide range of infectious diseases. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antimicrobials to ill-informed individuals who believe that antimicrobials can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. Viruses
Specific antiviral drugs are used to treat some viral infections. Antivirals are used to treat HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza, herpes viruses including varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus.

Why won't antibiotics cure us anymore? Medical treatment
As there were no antiviral drugs to treat the virus, and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness, such as aspirin, quinine, arsenics, digitalis, strychnine, epsom salts, castor oil, and iodine. 
Certain diseases like CHF, COPD, and some viral illnesses like COVID-19 can cause an increased risk for hospital readmissions. Our signature wellness programs, like Just Breathe, can help your patients stay out of the hospital. #chf #copd #COVID19 #respiratorycare #healthcare https://t.co/a966Shb0wl [SEP] Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high. COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5 million people (2.4% of the global population). People with COPD often have increased breathlessness and frequent colds before seeking treatment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for COPD exacerbations sharply decreased which may be attributable to reduction of emissions and cleaner air. Aclidinium, another long-acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life. Following a hospital admission pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to significantly reduce future hospital admissions, mortality and improve quality of life.The optimal exercise routine, use of noninvasive ventilation during exercise and intensity of exercise suggested for people with COPD, is unknown. Pulmonary infection. 
  Sad enough Covid-19 can cause SOME cardiovascular Diseases, and it has only been 7-8 months since the first case, with no vaccine in sight, things are going to get worse, the numbers will rise even more.. [SEP] As infectious diseases have become less lethal, and the most common causes of death in developed countries are now tumors and cardiovascular diseases, these conditions have received increased attention in medical research. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people across the globe. The health consequences of SUDs (for example, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, immunosuppression and central nervous system depression, and psychiatric disorders), and the associated environmental challenges (such as housing instability, unemployment, and criminal justice involvement), are associated with an increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Healthcare workers
Before COVID-19, healthcare workers already faced many stressors, including health risks, the possibility of infecting their household, and the stress of working with extremely sick patients. Aboriginal Australians suffer from high rates of heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and among Aboriginal Australians. 13 September
A study reports results indicating COVID-19 may significantly increase risk for Alzheimer's disease, similar to prior studies about long-term impacts besides long COVID on cardiovascular outcomes, diabetes, neurologic sequelae, mental health disorders, and general future mortality after COVID-19, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. These numbers do not include measures like years of potential life lost, far exceed the 5.42 million officially reported deaths, may make COVID-19 2021's leading cause of death, and are similar to the ~18 million estimated by another study (see 10 Mar). 
 COVID is also known to cause myocarditis, so it seems likely to me that this is caused by the spike protein, or an allergic reaction to the spike protein. Seems wrong to call it a side effect of the vaccine, per se. [SEP] There is a rare risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane covering the heart) after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The FDA and European Medicines Agency estimates the risk of myocarditis after the Covid-19 vaccine as 1 case per 100,000 of those who are vaccinated. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 vaccination was observed to be highest in males between 16–29 years of age, and after receiving the second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 
                                                 Covid causes blood clots that cause heart attack, stroke, general organ damage and affect cognition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are also much more vulnerable to dying from this damage if your circulatory system is already compromised by diabetes, obesity etc. [SEP] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism. Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Embolisms, depending on their specific location, can cause more significant effects like strokes, heart attacks, or even death. High blood LPS levels can then trigger a systemic inflammatory response and eventually lead to sepsis and related consequences like blood coagulation, multi-organ failure, necrosis, and central nervous system dysfunction. 
cause of cognitive injury could be seen if the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes covid-19, crosses the blood-brain barrier and directly attacks neural tissue [SEP] Repeated injury can cause progressive dementia over time, while a single injury located in an area critical for cognition such as the hippocampus, or thalamus, can lead to sudden cognitive decline. Other
Chronic inflammatory conditions that may affect the brain and cognition include Behçet's disease, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome, lupus, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The bacteria invade nerve tissue in the brain, increasing the permeability of the blood–brain barrier and promoting the onset of Alzheimer's. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours, and brain problems resulting from a previous infection. Failure of the blood–brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Neurodegenerative diseases can affect different parts of the brain, and can affect movement, memory, and cognition.Cerebral atherosclerosis is atherosclerosis that affects the brain. It contributes to the development of dementia, and has protein similarities to those found in Alzheimer’s disease.The brain, although protected by the blood–brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. 
Disappointing that  stewards are heavy handed with COVID 19 masking rules, hot weather increases asthma symptoms which could potentially cause health problems for some masked spectators. PA announcements need to take people with exemptions into account!  #ENGvNZ [SEP] Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. Vaccine
Face masks and respiratory hygiene
The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The pandemic impacted mental health, increasing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, affecting healthcare workers, patients and quarantined individuals.In late 2022, during the first northern hemisphere autumn and winter seasons following the widespread relaxation of global public health measures, North America and Europe experienced a surge in respiratory viruses and coinfections in both adults and children. 
  Tweeps did share #science when  atributed symptoms requiring urgent medical attention, to #TheCovidMyth that symptoms caused by being in close proximity to vaccinated person.  Symptoms could be fibroids, cervical/ovarian #cancer, menstrual disorders or #COVID19 https://t.co/a1CQiBaAMQ [SEP] Also, Ann noticed from the picture that Joe had the mumps. Symptoms
A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. The CDC lists various diseases by their signs and symptoms such as for measles which includes a high fever, conjunctivitis, and cough, followed a few days later by the measles rash. Measles for example has a prodromal presentation that includes a hacking cough, fever, and Koplik's spots in the mouth. They include unexplained weight loss, headache, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, and malaise. Easily spreadable viral infections such as COVID-19 may be asymptomatic but may still be transmissible. "B symptoms" in other diseases
Similar systemic symptoms can be found in non-cancerous states such as tuberculosis and various inflammatory or rheumatologic conditions. In these settings, the term "B symptoms" is sometimes colloquially applied to refer to such systemic or constitutional symptoms. 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/2AwZUDJlGn [SEP] Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure (after the barometer),    is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa (1,013.25 hPa), which is equivalent to 1,013.25 millibars, 760 mm Hg, 29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi. The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth; that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm. This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the Internet. Surface pressure
Surface pressure is the atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth's surface (terrain and oceans). The average pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is 1,013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure. Pressure comfort: the comfort of the human body's pressure receptors' (present in the skin) sensory response towards clothing. 
 What Pfizer or the CDC will not tell you is that the vaccine could cause every single symptom of COVID and you could lose a week+ of your life trying to recover from the things that’s suppose to “protect” you from COVID [SEP] Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Specific populations
Based on the results of a preliminary study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated with the COVID‑19 vaccine.A statement by the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) reported that the two agencies had reached a conclusion that the vaccine is safe and effective in children aged between 12 and 15 years.On 19 May 2021, experts commissioned by the Norwegian Medicines Agency concluded that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the likely cause of ten deaths of frail elderly patients in Norwegian nursing homes. They said that people with very short life expectancies have little to gain from vaccination, having a real risk of adverse reactions in the last days of life and of dying earlier.A 2021 report by the New South Wales Government (NSW Health) in Australia found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe for those with various forms of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, though it does note that the data on said groups is limited, due to their exclusion from many of the vaccine earlier trials held in 2020. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised on 9 December 2020 that people who have a history of "significant" allergic reaction should not receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine.

Product information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

   the vaccine can cause heart and brain issues too...maybe even cancer. Its been giving women fertility issues. We won't know till like 10yrs down the road any other side effects of this which could be same or worse than just getting covid immunity naturally. Remember Pox Parties? [SEP] Adverse effects
Vaccinations given to children, adolescents, or adults are generally safe. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
5/ In other words, the authors (who work at Oxford, home of the  vaccine) appear to have wanted to prove Covid-19 was more likely to cause these clots than vaccines.  BUT THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MRNA VACCINES ARE NEARLY AS LIKELY TO CAUSE CLOTS AS THE DNA VACCINES... [SEP] RNA
An mRNA vaccine (or RNA vaccine) is a novel type of vaccine which is composed of the nucleic acid RNA, packaged within a vector such as lipid nanoparticles. Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection, since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. When introduced into human tissue, the vaccine contains either self-replicating RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), which both cause cells to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). 
  COVID-19:[NEWLINE]1) directly causes viral pneumonia[NEWLINE]2) can create environment conducive to development of secondary bacterial pneumonia [NEWLINE]3) can result in intubation, creating risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever, non-productive cough, runny nose, and systemic symptoms (e.g. Cause
Common causes of viral pneumonia are:

Influenza virus A and B
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Human parainfluenza viruses (in children)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)Rarer viruses that commonly result in pneumonia include:

Adenoviruses (in military recruits)
Metapneumovirus
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV)
HantavirusesViruses that primarily cause other diseases, but sometimes cause pneumonia include:

Herpes simplex virus (HSV), mainly in newborns or young children
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)
Measles virus
Rubella virus
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), mainly in people with immune system problems
Smallpox virus
Dengue virusThe most commonly identified agents in children are respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. Some viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia. As with all infectious diseases, viral pneumonia preys on the immunocompromised as well as individuals with one or more comorbidities especially those with:

Trauma
Severe burns
Diabetes
Malnutrition
Poverty
Environmental Exposure

== External links == The severity of the condition is variable.Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also result in pneumonia. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia. 
  now that we have that out of the way. yes, people can say that a heart attack is "covid-19", and they're probably wrong. then again, covid-19 can cause failure's in organs. and a heart attack could occur from that i think? she could have also had covid, and had a heart attack. [SEP] COVID-19 misinformation – multiple theories proposing a wide variety of different things regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 itself and COVID-19 vaccines. Michael Cleveland: In October 2014, this 46-year-old man was taken to a hospital near Buffalo, New York after suffering a heart attack. Hillary Clinton: On September 11, 2016, WABC-TV journalist Joe Torres accidentally said that the American politician had died when reporting on a story about her falling ill at a 9/11 memorial service; Torres spoke of "Hillary Clinton's death" when he had intended to say "Hillary Clinton's health". Cesar Millan: On December 2, 2014, a fake news website reported that the famous "Dog Whisperer" had died of a heart attack. Another hoax article that surfaced in March 2014 claimed that he died of a heart attack.

I don’t think it’s that outlandish to assume that any lingering inflammation caused by covid infection would reignite briefly after the vaccine. Both cause a generalized inflammatory response. While vaccine can be more noticeable than the virus, it’s controlled & short-lived. 3/ [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19.

For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home.

Ladies, you should know about this👉’ Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can cause temporary lymph node enlargement and result in a “false positive” mammogram’. 👈 we found this out the hard way. [SEP] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home.

  Just b/c Covid-19 causes symptoms that look like the flu on the outside, we already know internal effects are different. How many kids & young people have silent cardiac damage? Can SARS-CoV-2 cause persistent or latent infection? (Google: persistent virus) [SEP] Signs are objective and externally observable; symptoms are a person's reported subjective experiences. Symptoms
A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading. The CDC lists various diseases by their signs and symptoms such as for measles which includes a high fever, conjunctivitis, and cough, followed a few days later by the measles rash. Syndrome
Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. Other syndromes such as acute coronary syndrome may have a number of possible causes. Dynamic and static
Dynamic symptoms are capable of change depending on circumstance, whereas static symptoms are fixed or unchanging regardless of circumstance. Easily spreadable viral infections such as COVID-19 may be asymptomatic but may still be transmissible.

Notes


== References == Proponents of the CDD believe this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead. This "diving response," in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex.As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be reevaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death.Some scientific literature is claimed to support the feasibility of cryonics. 2023

   SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Though COVID-19 can cause this, the condition COVID-19 infection resulting in ICU admission with respiratory support is more accurately called ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] bc it results in alveolar injury. #My$0.02 [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission
Virology
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the first identified strain of the SARS coronavirus species, severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). SARS often leads to shortness of breath and pneumonia, which may be direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.The average incubation period for SARS is 4–6 days, although it is rarely as short as 1 day or as long as 14 days.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): information on the international outbreak of the illness known as a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), provided by the US Centers for Disease Control Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1; or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV) is a strain of coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the respiratory illness responsible for the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. This virus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the causative pathogen of COVID-19, the propagation of which started the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-1. 
        (continued) as well as pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as diabetes and obesity ( here ).  SO, I will add, if someone had asthma and managed it their whole life then gets Covid and dies,  the Covid is what caused The death. [SEP] Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19.It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The CDC has found that obesity is the single strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. Complications
Most complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with obesity and respiratory disease as the strongest risk factors. 
So the second dose for the covid shot can cause something called covid arm? I totally could use a third arm. You do know where those fingers will be all day? Yep, on Twitter while I work. I bet you thought something else.  *it's about hives and not a 3rd arm [SEP] Following concerns of blood clotting events the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was largely discontinued for use, and those who had already received a first dose were encouraged to receive an mRNA vaccine as their second dose. The country has passed other large countries in coverage like the U.S. vaccination program.As new arrivals of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine came into the country in late May, provinces chose whether to administer second doses, for example as Ontario is going forward with, or providing people who took a first dose to choose a different second vaccine, as in British Columbia.The country's percentage of single doses had been disproportionately high in comparison to second doses, due to NACI's earlier recommendations for intervals of up to four months. This led to calls from medical experts for provinces to prioritize second doses, citing the possibility having only one dose would make populations vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 variants. The province of British Columbia had also followed suit and began plans to extend second dose administration to a four-month delay.On March 4, 2021, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that a maximum of four months or 112 days could be achieved effectively between second doses. Meanwhile, Ontario allowed people who received their first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine between March 10 and 19, 2021 to book second dose appointments of the same vaccine. Two weeks later, they changed their recommendations to suggest that a second dose of one of the mRNA vaccines after a first shot of AstraZeneca is "preferred", due to new evidence that seems to demonstrate an improved immune response on a mixed vaccine schedule. Administering the vaccines in three separate doses does not reduce the chance of adverse effects, and it increases the opportunity for infection by the two diseases not immunized against first. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for "coronavirus disease 2019". 
     How can cardiovascular damage be anecdotal? I believe the science is showing that Covid can cause long term effects. It is the second cause of death. This virus can not be wished away no matter how strong minded you are. [SEP] Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Cardiovascular risk assessment
Existing cardiovascular disease or a previous cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke, is the strongest predictor of a future cardiovascular event. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the most life-threatening of the diabetic complications and diabetics are two- to four-fold more likely to die of cardiovascular-related causes than nondiabetics. Moderate evidence was found that high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality; and some evidence was found for an increase in overall mortality, strokes, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Epidemiology
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases each year. Research
There is evidence that cardiovascular disease existed in pre-history, and research into cardiovascular disease dates from at least the 18th century. 
Another “deadly variant” that coincidentally attacks 12& younger right when needing Covid-19 Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA when vaccines are causing blood-clots, heart attacks & heart inflammation. Keep in mind heart disease/ failure is the #1 cause of death in U.S🤡🌎 https://t.co/1QyOgbSgYM [SEP] provides a summary of the US experience in 2020 with pharmacological EUA approvals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency issued these EUAs for the use of certain powerful antiviral drugs, and for the quantitative PCR swine flu test.On February 4, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary of HHS declared the public health emergency for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, for deployment of the FDA EUA for certain medical devices involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19. On April 16, 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.In December 2020, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted to recommend EUA for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It is used to treat COVID-19 in those infected by SARS-CoV-2. The emergency use authorization was only narrowly approved (13-10) because of questions about efficacy and concerns that molnupiravir's mutagenic effects could create new variants that evade immunity and prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were adults 18 and older with a pre-specified chronic medical condition or at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for other reasons who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine. The committee narrowly voted, 13 for and 10 opposed, to recommend authorization for adults with mild to moderate illness who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for molnupiravir for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.In October 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started a rolling review of molnupiravir.In November 2021, molnupiravir was approved in the U.K. by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the treatment of established infections of COVID-19. 
I have issues with thrombosis & embolisms and stuff and tbh I'm more afraid to get the virus than anything b/c covid is known to cause really bad inflammation,  hypercoagulation, clots etc. Much rather be vaccinated. Better odds. [SEP] Jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications, including: systemic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and papilledema. Some people have a higher risk of developing thrombosis and its possible development into thromboembolism. Some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis. In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. Hence thromboprophylaxis (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. Increased levels of inflammation may lead to higher risk of clotting as well as an increased risk of stent/device subsequent thrombosis. A low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation, they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea, or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, there is a lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness.Inferior vena cava filters should be removed as soon as it becomes safe to start using anticoagulation. 
Percentage of total cancer deaths are 21.3%.and you're worried about COVID-19?[NEWLINE]Race & sex also play a role in a person’s risk of developing cancer, depending on the type. That said, lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer in both men & women. [SEP] As of the early 21st century, 56 million people die per year. The leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging, leading to various complications known as aging-associated diseases. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes. Tobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people worldwide in the 21st century, a World Health Organization report warned.Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. The causes of death are different in different parts of the world. Of all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day. Of these, two-thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90% (i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence).Physiological death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible. 
  Covid is turning out to be a vascular virus with respiratory symptoms. Covid causes heart failure and heart attacks. [SEP] Prolonged fever is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac involvement. The main symptoms were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain was most common in older children. Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing. In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. Signs can include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection. Cognitive impairment is associated with the declining ability to cope with the basic activities of daily living.It is unclear if those with COPD are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, though if infected they are at risk of hospitalization and developing severe COVID-19. Both of these conditions may result in pulmonary heart disease also classically known as cor pulmonale. Congestive heart failure
Airway edema may cause wheezing in CHF. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect. https://t.co/NJQ1EbxP2I [SEP] Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of chemoreceptors. Gustatory system (taste)
The gustatory system or the sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the multimodal integration of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations. The inability to taste is called ageusia. Olfactory system (smell)
Like the sense of taste, the sense of smell, or the olfactory system, is also responsive to chemical stimuli. The inability to smell is called anosmia. Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional spice and seasoning levels for food to be tasted. 
‘We made a big mistake’ — COVID vaccine spike protein travels from injection site, can cause organ damage https://t.co/i1nZiEhmiX [SEP] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection, since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses. When introduced into human tissue, the vaccine contains either self-replicating RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), which both cause cells to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID‑19 Vaccine Tracker. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. 
Covid seems to wake up the same age-old mechanism in our white blood cells that causes long-term brain and nerve inflammation in multiple sclerosis (an ancient virus that has become part of our DNA). It could explain why certain people get neurological #LongCovid symptoms 🤕 https://t.co/5wnIuiQveQ [SEP] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. Research conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain damage. Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
 Yes! Oral contraceptives cause more blood clots and nobody is doing anything about that!!! Like 1 per 1,000 compared to basically 1 per MILLION with the Covid vaccine. Maddening. [SEP] Hypercoagulability
Estrogen in high doses can increase risk of blood clots. Side effects
It is generally accepted that the health risks of oral contraceptives are lower than those from pregnancy and birth, and "the health benefits of any method of contraception are far greater than any risks from the method". Heart and blood vessels
Combined oral contraceptives increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)).While lower doses of estrogen in COC pills may have a lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction compared to higher estrogen dose pills (50 μg/day), users of low estrogen dose COC pills still have an increased risk compared to non-users. These risks are greatest in women with additional risk factors, such as smoking (which increases risk substantially) and long-continued use of the pill, especially in women over 35 years of age.The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman-years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared with 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. In comparison, venous thromboembolism occurs in 100–200 per 100.000 pregnant women every year.One study showed more than a 600% increased risk of blood clots for women taking COCPs with drospirenone compared with non-users, compared with 360% higher for women taking birth control pills containing levonorgestrel. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated studies evaluating the health of more than 800,000 women taking COCPs and found that the risk of VTE was 93% higher for women who had been taking drospirenone COCPs for 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking drospirenone COCPs for 7–12 months, compared with women taking other types of oral contraceptives.Based on these studies, in 2012 the FDA updated the label for drospirenone COCPs to include a warning that contraceptives with drospirenone may have a higher risk of dangerous blood clots.A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found that combined birth control pills were associated with 7.6-fold higher risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare form of stroke in which blood clotting occurs in the cerebral venous sinuses. It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish an increased risk of venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. 
  Vaccines allow you to build immunity without suffering the damaging effects of the disease itself. COVID-19 can cause serious long-term health problems and even be fatal. All of this can be avoided by getting vaccinated.  https://t.co/segNhg4ePd [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people across the globe. Explain COVID-19 and required interventions in age-appropriate ways. Mental health professionals call for schools and education institutions everywhere to implement a number of health promotion programs in their schools that may teach students how to prevent succumbing to adverse mental health issues and how to cope with the reality and continuing effects of COVID-19 so that it does not get in the way of their education and future endeavors. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. This ambitious goal was considered achievable for several reasons: the vaccine afforded exceptional protection; there was only one type of the virus; there were no animals that naturally carried it; the incubation period of the infection was known and rarely varied from 12 days; and infections always gave rise to symptoms, so it was clear who had the disease.Following mass vaccinations, disease detection and containment were central to the eradication campaign. Immunity to the disease following an infection is lifelong; that afforded by vaccination is long term but eventually wanes.The use of the vaccine has been controversial. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013. Although the yellow fever vaccine is one of the most successful ever developed, epidemics  continue to occur. 
   immunity escape you talk about is not proven concerning the effect of this vaccin. Which is proved is it's his high  %age of efficiency against covid and which is certain is that covid is a mortal virus which also can cause severe after effects if you don t die. [SEP] With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.Many vaccines are based on acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals, and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.At least 19 countries have no-fault compensation programs to provide compensation for those with severe adverse effects of vaccination. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. Sveriges riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, predicts that efficient vaccination against COVID-19 has macroeconomic benefits. As of February 2021, the Public Health Agency had not recommended COVID-19 vaccination to children under 18 unless the child belonged to a high-risk group. 
 So what? COVID-19 is thousands of times more likely to be fatal or cause long term effects. This is a global crisis and war on a virus. People need to calibrate their thinking a little. This obsession with minute vaccine risks is dangerous and unethical. [SEP] Cognitive biases
Numerous cognitive biases can influence people's judgment of the importance of existential risks, including scope insensitivity, hyperbolic discounting, availability heuristic, the conjunction fallacy, the affect heuristic, and the overconfidence effect.Scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be. Similarly, people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups.Eliezer Yudkowsky theorizes that scope neglect plays a role in public perception of existential risks:
Substantially larger numbers, such as 500 million deaths, and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as the extinction of the entire human species, seem to trigger a different mode of thinking... People who would never dream of hurting a child hear of existential risk, and say, "Well, maybe the human species doesn't really deserve to survive". To some, this makes future warnings seem less credible. Example: Measures to prevent outbreaks of new highly infectious diseases. Skeptics and opponents
Psychologist Steven Pinker has called existential risk a "useless category" that can distract from real threats such as climate change and nuclear war. 1986) examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits.

  And yes they’re included in the numbers. Covid causes inflammation in your circulatory system which can lead to things like blood clots and heart attacks. [SEP] In contrast, too much inflammation, in the form of chronic inflammation, is associated with various diseases, such as hay fever, periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis. Pathogens, allergens, toxins, burns, and frostbite are some of the typical causes of acute inflammation. Elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors. These new insights on inflammation contribute to the etiology of atherosclerosis, and the practical clinical applications in risk stratification and the targeting of therapy for atherosclerosis. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes. These proteins include C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and serum amyloid P, which cause a range of systemic effects including:

Leukocyte numbers
Inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:

Leukocytosis is often seen during inflammation induced by infection, where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood, especially immature cells. See also

From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #LongCovid  https://t.co/ydwF4NAbIW [SEP] 16 April – A review suggests that global prevalence of long COVID conditions after infection could be as high as 43%, with the most common symptoms being fatigue and memory problems. 13 September
A study reports results indicating COVID-19 may significantly increase risk for Alzheimer's disease, similar to prior studies about long-term impacts besides long COVID on cardiovascular outcomes, diabetes, neurologic sequelae, mental health disorders, and general future mortality after COVID-19, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past:
Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), β-CoV
Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), β-CoV
Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), α-CoV
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), α-CoV–Three human coronaviruses produce potentially severe symptoms:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2003)
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2012)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), β-CoV (identified in 2019)These cause the diseases commonly called SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 respectively. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species.Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ≈34%). 
If you’ve had COVID, your first vaccine dose may cause worse side effects. Here’s why https://t.co/NENybrfQbp [SEP] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Typical side effects are stronger and more common in younger people and in subsequent doses, and up to 20% of people report a disruptive level of side effects after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. For example, although vaccination may trigger some side effects, the effects experienced from an infection could be worse. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
  See this please to get the seriousness of the matter at hand. Dr Mark Gordon has a good idea of what Long Covid is and compares it to brain injury caused by explosions. This is brain inflammation and damage. Don’t work through it. Strokes, fits...etc. [NEWLINE]https://t.co/sQAcI3MnoU [SEP] Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of conditions characterized by long-term, multi-system, often severe health problems persisting or appearing after the typical recovery period of COVID-19. Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. Terminology and definitions
Overview
Long COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long COVID—A Practical Guide. A review of what is known about long COVID by the NIHR

Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt told Parliament that not one life had been lost to Covid this year.  With ZERO DEATHS as the benchmark, it's hard to defend a vaccine that's been the cause of 2 deaths in the same period. #DeathByVaccine #COVID #AZdeath https://t.co/JVdvpIMkIO [SEP] The Minister for Health and Aged Care is the position in the Australian cabinet responsible for national health and wellbeing and medical research. This was the only area of public health in which the Commonwealth had authority at the time of Federation. 3 Morrison was appointed as Minister for Health by the Governor-General on Morrison's advice in March 2020, with both Morrison and Hunt holding the position of Minister for Health until May 2022. Later, the department assumed responsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health matters from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.After the October 1998 election, the department was abolished and replaced by the Australian Federal Department of Health and Aged Care, named to reflect new responsibilities and functions. The Australian Federal Department of Health and Ageing was abolished in 2013 and replaced by the current Australian Federal Department of Health on 18 September 2013 by way of an Administrative Arrangements Order issued by the Governor-General of Australia on the recommendation of the Abbott government. He went on to become "the public face of Australia's fight against COVID-19" during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, giving several press conferences with the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and Health Minister Greg Hunt.

  So sorry for your loss. Even the J&J is way less likely to cause serious side effects than COVID. There’s a risk for sure w/any of the vaccines, but for the majority of Americans (w/o an allergy to ingredients in vaccine &no autoimmune disorders), the risk is way less than COVID. [SEP] Some treatments used to cure mycotic infections can cause massive hair loss. It is not indicated for women and is not recommended in pregnant women (as it is known to cause birth defects in fetuses). Side effects in about 2% of males include decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. These procedures are generally chosen by those who are self-conscious about their hair loss, but they are expensive and painful, with a risk of infection and scarring. In medicine, a side effect is an effect, whether therapeutic or adverse, that is unintended; although the term is predominantly employed to describe adverse effects, it can also apply to beneficial, but unintended, consequences of the use of a drug. Feverfew – pregnant women should avoid using this herb, as it can trigger uterine contractions which could lead to premature labour or miscarriage. Side effects include allergic dermatitis and hay fever.

           I believe mine was a fibro flare caused from vaccine. It’s been 13 days since vaccine & Tim’s just now getting sick. So not sure what’s going on with him. Either a stomach virus - there’s one going around or Covid cause it takes 2-4 weeks after vaccine to be fully immune. [SEP] Sometimes, protection fails for vaccine-related reasons such as failures in vaccine attenuation, vaccination regimens or administration.Failure may also occur for host-related reasons if the host's immune system does not respond adequately or at all. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination.

      Incorrect. Vaccine do not normally cause blood clots. Nor do viruses...SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine do.  We cannot ignore this. We can rationally protect ourselves from harm. [SEP] Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. blood clots (thrombosis). These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). On 19 March, the NIAC recommended that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine could continue to be used in Ireland following approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 18 March.On 8 April, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) began an investigation after the first case of a very rare blood clot in the brain of a person after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine was confirmed in a 40-year-old Dublin woman.On 12 April, following a lengthy meeting, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommend that only people over 60 years of age should get the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and that a second dose of the vaccine should not be given to anyone who developed unusual blood clots with low platelets after the first dose. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare. On 12 March, several countries stopped using the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine- due to blood clotting problems, specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link to thrombosis, leading several countries to resume administering the vaccine. 
  Of course it is - my own mothers lungs where so damaged by Covid it caused Covid-pneumonitis in which the lungs inflame and cause more damage, it took 2 months until her lungs barely functioning which led to her death, this was caused by Covid therefore the caused by Covid... [SEP] Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. Other diseases
Several other diseases that cause inflammation of the lung increase one's risk of lung cancer. This association is strongest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder – the risk is highest in those with the most inflammation, and reduced in those whose inflammation is treated with inhaled corticosteroids.

 There is a round of coronavirus cold every fall and winter, so 93% of people are immune to -ncov. Immunity is achieved through lymphocytes. After 2019-ncov infection, lymphocytes were depleted. Antipyretics and corticosteroids suppress lymphocyte immunity and cause COVID-19. [SEP] Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Common cold
Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus. The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold. The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Prevention and treatment
A number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. WHO adopted the name of the disease as "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020, and used "2019 novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" for the virus.

False positive and false negative rates
The false positive rate (FPR) is the proportion of all negatives that still yield positive test outcomes, i.e., the conditional probability of a positive test result given an event that was not present. The false positive rate is equal to the significance level. See also

 If u have had covid u don’t need the vaccine it can cause problems by adding more antibodies to ur other antibiotics that devel in ur body from having the virus [SEP] Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity of the flu if a person contracts a strain that the vaccine did not contain. Flu vaccines are contraindicated for people who have experienced a severe allergic reaction in response to a flu vaccine or to any component of the vaccine. COVID-19
An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. Preliminary research indicates that influenza vaccination does not prevent COVID-19, but may reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. This applies generally to all COVID-19 vaccines, including those not yet given formal approval. 
  COVID-19 causes inflammation throughout vtge body, including the brain. Inflammation has been implicated as an underlying cause for depression and is a known cause for dementia. [SEP] Thus, negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can, in turn, lead to depression. In addition, there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines, setting the brain into a "sickness mode". Inflammations that lead to serious depression could be caused by common infections such as those caused by a virus, bacteria or even parasites. Inflammation also plays a role in diabetes risk and new research continues to support this conclusion.Research suggests chronic inflammation plays a major role in COVID-19 morbidity. In severe cases, COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm which contributes to excessive and uncontrolled inflammation of organs, particularly respiratory tissues. Amyloid causes inflammation around the senile plaques of the brain, and too much build up of this inflammation leads to changes in the brain that cannot be controlled, leading to the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Other
Chronic inflammatory conditions that may affect the brain and cognition include Behçet's disease, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome, lupus, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The bacteria invade nerve tissue in the brain, increasing the permeability of the blood–brain barrier and promoting the onset of Alzheimer's. 
So kind of a bad choice when your target for the vaccine can cause side effects in its own right.  Still this vaccine has been a huge net positive but hopefully the he next generation of covid vaccines finds something a little less harmful as the target https://t.co/Efos6smnvg [SEP] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation, and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. According to the EMA "the benefits of Comirnaty in preventing COVID‑19 continue to outweigh any risks, and there are no recommended changes regarding the use of this vaccine."

 Diabetes causes blood sugar spikes. So does eating sugar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blood sugar spikes cause arterial inflammation, which increases risk for both heart disease and covid complications.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]People who ate more sugar, died sooner.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All true facts. Rationalize them as you will. [SEP] Complications
All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and about 75% of deaths in people with diabetes are due to coronary artery disease. The following is a list of disorders that may increase the risk of diabetes:

Pathophysiology
Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1. Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk. Long-term hyperglycemia causes many health problems including heart disease, cancer, eye, kidney, and nerve damage.Blood sugar levels above 16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) can cause fatal reactions. The most common cause of hyperglycemia is diabetes. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. 
The predominant symptoms of ‘long COVID’ are psychological in nature, with anxiety and depression being most common. But those of course are also exactly the conditions which have been caused in, literally, millions of people, especially young people, by the lockdowns. [SEP] The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. Longer-term effects
Some early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to intensive care units (ICU).Between 5% and 50% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID, a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease. The pandemic impacted mental health, increasing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, affecting healthcare workers, patients and quarantined individuals.In late 2022, during the first northern hemisphere autumn and winter seasons following the widespread relaxation of global public health measures, North America and Europe experienced a surge in respiratory viruses and coinfections in both adults and children. 
       Not all brands of the vaccine can cause problems, there are brands that have higher lethal rates than others. The death rate of COVID is said to be 10%. It is probable that some vaccines (Maybe Johnson& Johnson) have a higher lethal rate than that [SEP] Those measures were prolonged until 26 April 2020.On 23 December, following an unexpectedly quick authorization by Swissmedic of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccination campaign was launched in several cantons. A 90-year-old woman from the Lucerne region became the first vaccinated patient in continental Europe outside Russia. The first vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19, was approved for use in the UK on 2 December 2020, the first of the 800,000 immediately available doses was administered on 8 December. The second vaccine approved for use in the UK was the Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was approved for use on 30 December 2020, with the first dose of this vaccine given on 4 January 2021. Vaccination
In early 2021, EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen was criticised for the EU's slow rollout, and she noted that the EU was “late to authorise” and said that ordering vaccines on behalf of member states was “the right thing to do”. Some countries withheld recommending the AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns of blood clots. By 20 June 2021, nearly half the population of the European Union had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination.In November 2021, a study by the ECDC estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved since the start of vaccination roll-out in the European region. 2020
The 2020 Festival was cancelled for health concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
vaccines for COVID-19 are stopped as a matter of urgency in order to protect the public from serious harm and death.   It is also documented that Polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues relating to fertility.  9 [SEP] Preservatives may be used at various stages of the production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.Many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Antibiotics are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during production and storage of the vaccine. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.When increased production of vaccines was urgently needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the World Trade Organization and governments around the world evaluated whether to waive intellectual property rights and patents on COVID-19 vaccines, which would "eliminate all potential barriers to the timely access of affordable COVID-19 medical products, including vaccines and medicines, and scale up the manufacturing and supply of essential medical products". However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Planning and development
Since January 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.Multiple steps along the entire development path are evaluated, including:
the level of acceptable toxicity of the vaccine (its safety),
targeting vulnerable populations,
the need for vaccine efficacy breakthroughs,
the duration of vaccination protection,
special delivery systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection),
dose regimen,
stability and storage characteristics,
emergency use authorization before formal licensing,
optimal manufacturing for scaling to billions of doses, and
dissemination of the licensed vaccine. In July 2021, The BMJ reported that countries have thrown out over 250,000 vaccine doses as supply exceeded demand and strict laws prevented the sharing of vaccines. A survey by The New York Times found that over a million doses of vaccine had been thrown away in ten U.S. states because federal regulations prohibit recalling them, preventing their redistribution abroad. 
Great Article about blot clots and vaccines! Thanks for sharing!  “... and “COVID-19 is far more likely to cause blood clots than a COVID-19 vaccine” are phrases that have been repeated like mantras. That needs to continue.” https://t.co/nnUwVtZpfW [SEP] Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. Viral vector vaccines were also developed for the COVID‑19 pandemic after the technology was previously cleared for Ebola.As multiple COVID‑19 vaccines have been authorized or licensed for use, real-world vaccine effectiveness (RWE) is being assessed using case control and observational studies. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. In mid-May 2021, UNICEF was also critical of the fact that most proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early in 2022.In July 2021, the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization said in a joint statement: "As many countries are struggling with new variants, and a third wave of COVID‑19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth. 
Even the New York Times is admitting:  “In rare cases, the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has led to severe and sometimes fatal blood clots. Newly published research from Germany and Norway describes a powerful immune reaction that may be the cause”. [SEP] In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Although no causal link with vaccination has been shown, several other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia also halted the vaccine rollout over the following days while waiting for the EMA to finish a safety review triggered by the cases.In April 2021, the EMA concluded its safety review and concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects while reaffirming the overall benefits of the vaccine. Then, on 15 April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommended to the government to permanently suspended vaccination with AstraZeneca due to the "rare but severe incidents with low platelet counts, blood clots, and haemorrhages," since in the case of Norway, "the risk of dying after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine would be higher than the risk of dying from the disease, particularly for younger people." Safety review
In March 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that there is no indication that vaccination has been the cause of the observed clotting issues, which were not listed as side effects of the vaccine. AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found. Blood clots
Videos posted to Facebook and Instagram have claimed without evidence that 62 percent of people given an mRNA vaccine develop blood clots, and that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine causes blood to clot "in a minute or two". Studies have found possible causal links between the AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines and a rare clotting disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), but the risk is low for most people, with 47 confirmed reports of the condition out of more than 15 million recipients of the Janssen vaccine in the United States as of October 2021. A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. 
  Take a look at the Epstein-Barr virus - one of the primary causes of 'glandular fever'.  We know there's a link between it and cancers, neurological disease.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid-19 seems similar but more serious in that it's highly infectious and can kill people w/o causing chronic disease. [SEP] Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. Infections with the virus caused the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. Cancer
Viruses are an established cause of cancer in humans and other species. ;
Cancers, particularly blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphomas;
Metabolic disorders, e.g., gout, and porphyria; and
Inherited metabolic disorder, e.g., Fabry disease.Adult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.In addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.Teething is not a cause of fever. Epidemiology
Fever is one of the most common medical signs. It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.Infections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Typhus was also a significant killer during the US Civil War, although typhoid fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War "camp fever". For example, it is thought that infection with the Hepatitis E virus, which is often initially asymptomatic may provoke neurological disorders, but there are many other examples as well. 
Similar to medications and other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. Vaccine reactions are rare. Info about side effects: https://t.co/0zWPiWE9RX  VIDEO: https://t.co/kgwjzNMEnu [SEP] It may cause attenuated vaccines (such as typhoid vaccine) to not work well. Common side effects include rash, nausea, and diarrhea. In very rare cases, it causes severe side effects such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, and C. difficile infection (that can range from mild diarrhea to serious pseudomembranous colitis). The most common side effects, experienced by about 10% of users are diarrhea and rash. Less common side effects can be nausea, vomiting, itching, and blood dyscrasias. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. As with all chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Contraindications
Because an intramuscular injection can be used to administer many types of medications, specific contraindications depend in large part on the medication being administered.

   Might sound counter intuitive, but even the common cold (which are caused by corona viruses) may help our immune system recognise Covid and respond to it better.  Maybe the same happens with the flu. [SEP] Common cold and flu treatments
In March 2020, a photo circulated online showing a 30-year-old Indian textbook that lists aspirin, antihistamines, and nasal spray as treatments for coronavirus diseases. "Coronavirus". In early 2020, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a "specific form of the common cold", stated that "the coronavirus panic is dumb", and that the "danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. But we've never closed down the country for the flu." On March 27, he stated: "You can call it a flu. "COVID", he observed. But we've never closed down the country for the flu." On March 27, he stated: "You can call it a flu". 
Study: Pfizer's RNA-based covid vaccine could cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases, so its approval was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit. https://t.co/CyX9P1k9J5 https://t.co/vSTarg3dIG [SEP] "On 10 October 2022, during a session of the European Parliament's Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pfizer executive Janine Small testified that the company had not evaluated their COVID-19 vaccine for its ability to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus prior to its release to the general public. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. On 23 August 2021, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They said that people with very short life expectancies have little to gain from vaccination, having a real risk of adverse reactions in the last days of life and of dying earlier.A 2021 report by the New South Wales Government (NSW Health) in Australia found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe for those with various forms of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, though it does note that the data on said groups is limited, due to their exclusion from many of the vaccine earlier trials held in 2020. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. It is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be approved for national use after undergoing large scale trials, and the first mRNA vaccine to be authorized for use in humans. The recommendation was accepted by the European Commission the same day.On 23 February 2021, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine under its standard marketing authorization procedure. On 23 August 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged sixteen years and older.The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine was authorized in Canada on 16 September 2021, for people aged twelve and older.In July 2022, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged twelve years and older.In September 2022, the CHMP of the EMA recommended converting the conditional marketing authorizations of the vaccine into standard marketing authorizations. 
Expert Cardiologist ( Dr. Richard Flem­ing, physi­cist-nuclear car­di­ol­o­gist) recently issued a dire warn­ing !  Covid Vaccines Could Cause Mad Cow Disease ! ,  “I’m not anti-vax, “I’m just anti-bad medicine Flemming said”  My God ! More mad cows ! 😱🐮 https://t.co/r63fYNfii2 [SEP] The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner (who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine) to denote cowpox. COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. There is a rare risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane covering the heart) after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. To help overcome this problem, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi announced that they would make their digital vaccination management platform CoWIN open to the global community. "Coronavirus vaccine – weekly summary of Yellow Card reporting". 
    It doesn't matter that only 14k people died of covid alone. This is completely fucking irrelevant, especially considering the fact that Covid literally causes things like pneumonia, which are included in that CDC page. [SEP] Misinformation
After the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.In September 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood. As of 22 June 2023, the pandemic had caused 768,186,332 cases and 6,945,701 confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest pandemics in history. Deaths
As of 10 March 2023, more than 6.88 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 16.5 to 26.8 million (≈20.2 million) by 3 February 2023 by The Economist, as well as over 18.5 million by 1 April 2023 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and ≈18.2 million (earlier) deaths between 1 January 2020, and 31 December 2021, by a comprehensive international study. Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.In May 2022, the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14.9 million compared to 5.4 million reported COVID-19 deaths, with the majority of the unreported 9.5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus, rather than indirect deaths. Some deaths were because people with other conditions could not access medical services.A December 2022 WHO study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during 2020 and 2021, again concluding ≈14.8 million excess early deaths occurred, reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them, addressing criticisms. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. See also

Stay #InTheKnow about the COVIID-19 vaccine: 1 - The Pfizer & Moderna vaccines require two doses, 3–4 weeks apart;  2 - The vaccines can’t cause COVID-19;  3 - Vaccines provide protection, but won’t prevent infection. #JTCHS #WeKnow https://t.co/OQUnaWSE58 [SEP] Initial advice indicated that vaccination required two doses given 21 days apart, but the interval was later extended to up to 42 days in the US, and up to four months in Canada.Clinical trials began in April 2020; by November 2020, the vaccine entered phase III clinical trials, with over 40,000 people participating. Distribution and storage is a logistical challenge because the vaccine needs to be stored at extremely low temperatures.In August 2022, a bivalent version of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent) was authorized for use as a booster dose in individuals twelve years of age and older in the United States. It also stated that people with "severely weakened" immune systems can receive an extra dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine starting at least 28 days after their second dose. Bivalent booster vaccination
In August 2022, the "Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)" (in short: "COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent") received an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a booster dose in individuals aged twelve years of age and older. Society and culture
About 649 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, including about 55 million doses in children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) were administered in the EU/EEA from authorization to 26 June 2022. Initially, most COVID‑19 vaccines were two-dose vaccines, with the sole exception being the single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now authorized bivalent vaccines to protect against the original COVID-19 strain and its Omicron variant. Effectiveness
Duration of immunity
As of 2021, available evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least six months. 
  It's the norm for a death certificate to list >1 cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most common 'other causes' are conditions that can be CAUSED by severe Covid - e.g. pneumonia or respiratory failure, and chronic conditions such as diabetes that people can live with for years, until catching Covid. [SEP] Afterward, a death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor or by an administrative office, upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death. The leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. The causes of death are different in different parts of the world. In low-income countries, where less than one in five of all people reach the age of 70, and more than a third of all deaths are among children under 15, people predominantly die of infectious diseases.In animals, predation can be a common cause of death, livestock have a 6% death rate from predation. Unnatural causes of death include suicide and predation. Natural selection

 I really can’t believe that a steroid based treatment wasn’t already used widely in Covid19 https://t.co/FYuDGMTxwJ late dad had COPD and he was on them practically 365 days for decades ! I know covid & copd arent the same but both cause breathlessness amongst other things. [SEP] Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5 million people (2.4% of the global population). Corticosteroids
Inhaled corticosteroids are anti-inflammatories that are recommended by GOLD as a first-line maintenance treatment in COPD cases with repeated exacerbations. It is essentially used in treating those with chronic bronchitis along with systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids given orally can improve lung function and shorten hospital stays but their use is recommended for only five to seven days; longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and death. Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD was published in the late 1950s. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with the fever.Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough – one that produces sputum – that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. 
Wearing a mask does cause disease, harm the immune system or create any healthy problems   https://t.co/wMCxAkV27U [SEP] The document presumed that the disease burden of mass infection could be tolerated, that any infection would confer long term sterilizing immunity, and it made no mention of physical distancing, masks, contact tracing, or long COVID, which has left patients with debilitating symptoms months after the initial infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) and numerous academic and public-health bodies have stated that the strategy is dangerous and lacks a sound scientific basis. And if you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases, they will tell you that that is risky, and you'll wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths. Firstly, it says nothing about harm suffered by people in low-risk groups, even though a significant number of patients who recover from COVID-19, including people who experience no symptoms, have been shown to have heart and lung damage. The health consequences of SUDs (for example, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, immunosuppression and central nervous system depression, and psychiatric disorders), and the associated environmental challenges (such as housing instability, unemployment, and criminal justice involvement), are associated with an increased risk for contracting COVID-19. COVID-19 has affected social structures across cultures, and for people living with PTSD, global measures that regulate the body by means of school closures, border restrictions, social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing, expose the ‘population to feelings of intense fear and helplessness’. These masks are used to bring the person wearing them luck and good fortune in hunts. The masks vary enormously but are characterized by the great invention. Shaman masks or plaque masks (nepcetaq sg nepcetak dual nepcetat pl) were empowered by shamans and are powerful ceremonial masks represented a shaman's helping spirit (tuunraq). 
Covid-19 can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus and dizziness https://t.co/V5itwb4NX4 [SEP] It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and dizziness or lightheadedness (vertigo). pneumococcal, meningococcal, haemophilus influenzae may damage the cochlea – Hearing loss is one of the most common after-effects of bacterial meningitis. People with sudden deafness often become dizzy, have ringing in their ears (tinnitus), or both. Excessive earwax can also cause tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears, ear fullness, hearing loss and ear pain.Impacted earwax is more common in those with Down's syndrome, due to the smaller, curved shape of the ear canal. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of ototoxicity include partial or profound hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus.The cochlea is primarily a hearing structure situated in the inner ear. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficulty walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues. Other medicinal ototoxic drugs
At high doses, quinine, aspirin and other salicylates may also cause high-pitch tinnitus and hearing loss in both ears, typically reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Drug exposures mixed with noise potentially lead to increased risk of ototoxic hearing loss. 
#covid19 a risk for a severe case is highly linked to #obesity. And #diet #nutrition #processed foods is the main cause.  #shame does not work. Listen & learn https://t.co/HcVtMGzNBQ [SEP] The CDC has found that obesity is the single strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. Diet
Excess appetite for palatable, high-calorie food (especially fat, sugar, and certain animal proteins) is seen as the primary factor driving obesity worldwide, likely because of imbalances in neurotransmitters affecting the drive to eat. Total food energy consumption has been found to be related to obesity.The widespread availability of dietary guidelines has done little to address the problems of overeating and poor dietary choice. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Causes of obesity
"In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity, complications of diabetes, anxiety disorders, and the total number of conditions.During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it was  not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested. Obesity is a risk factor for many chronic physical and mental illnesses. A study from Mexico found that obesity alone was responsible for a 2.7 times increased risk of death from COVID-19, while comorbidities with diabetes, immunosuppression or high blood pressure increased the risk further. 
   The coronavirus is related to HIV and HIV can cause seizures if there is infection in the central nervous system also sudden cardiac arrest can cause a short period of seizing. [SEP] Provoked seizures are due to a temporary event such as low blood sugar, alcohol withdrawal, abusing alcohol together with prescription medication, low blood sodium, fever, brain infection, or concussion. Causes
Seizures have a number of causes. A number of conditions are associated with seizures but are not epilepsy including: most febrile seizures and those that occur around an acute infection, stroke, or toxicity. Seizures in babies are most commonly caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, central nervous system (CNS) infections, trauma, congenital CNS abnormalities, and metabolic disorders. A number of disorders including: low blood sugar, low blood sodium, hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia, high blood sodium, low blood calcium and high blood urea levels may cause seizures. Medications
Both medication and drug overdoses can result in seizures, as may certain medication and drug withdrawal. Infection, such as encephalitis or meningitis

Stress
Stress can induce seizures in people with epilepsy, and is a risk factor for developing epilepsy. Non-epileptic seizures may also occur due to a number of other reasons. 
  I just saw that FB won't allow anyone to see the vid I shared "Doctors Speak Out About This Powerful Covid Treatment".  "...information that could cause physical harm" Very annoying. Meanwhile I've begun IVM as prophylaxis. Feeling good about that.  Thank u Dr. Kory! [SEP] Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.The first COVID‑19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December 2020 by the UK medicines regulator MHRA. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects." Misinformation
After the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.In September 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood. "Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19". "JHMI Clinical Recommendations for Available Pharmacologic Therapies for COVID-19" (PDF). Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 14 January 2022 (Report). Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home or spending more time outdoors, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, wearing a mask in public, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items. By 18 November 2022, while cases in the U.S. had declined, COVID variants BQ.1/BQ.1.1 had become dominant in the country.In March 2020, as cases of community transmission were confirmed across Canada, all of its provinces and territories declared states of emergency. 
Fauci's 2,000 emails a day show how little U.S. officials knew of Covid pandemic  We were played!!! This lock down, mask (oh leading cause of respiratory pneumonia), our freedom all put on hold the joke of the millennium!!!!!!! https://t.co/kiSZGQJiTx [SEP] COVID-19 pandemic
According to The Washington Post, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fauci was "mostly unknown outside the medical community". In the latter interview, Fauci said that COVID-19 could become a "global pandemic which would then have significant implications for" the United States.In March 2020, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.In a March 8, 2020, interview, Fauci stated that "right now in the United States, people [who are not infected] should not be walking around with masks", but "if you want to do it, that's fine". On July 7, 2020, during a press conference, Fauci stated that it was a "false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death" for COVID-19 in the country: "There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency." "On October 18, 2020, Fauci mentioned that he "wasn't surprised" Donald Trump contracted COVID-19. "When asked if the 2021 United States Capitol attack was a COVID-19 superspreader event, Fauci stated: "I think for those people there, they probably put themselves at an increased risk because they essentially did not adhere to the fundamentals of public health and COVID-19 context which is universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds in congregate settings. "On January 23, 2021, Fauci was quoted saying that letting the science speak on the pandemic got him "into a little bit of trouble" and got "push-back from people in the White House, including the president", during the Trump administration. These emails contain information about how the United States and Fauci initially responded to COVID-19.On June 22, 2021, Fauci said that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the "greatest threat" to eliminating COVID-19 in the United States.In December 2021, Fauci, along with virologist Jeffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens endorsed the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, advocating in favor of "an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full "universe" of existing and emerging coronaviruses.

  It’s a politicised 99.98% survival rate virus. ‘Fully vaccinated’ in the states are testing positive for covid. It’s not a vaccine, it’s an experimental ( until 2025 ), mRNA gene therapy that causes autoimmune diseases and sterilisation to name a few. [SEP] A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. RNA
An mRNA vaccine (or RNA vaccine) is a novel type of vaccine which is composed of the nucleic acid RNA, packaged within a vector such as lipid nanoparticles. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. Developed by Cadila Healthcare, it is the first DNA vaccine approved for humans. An example is the RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine licensed to Merck that is being used in 2018 to combat ebola in Congo. Bacterial vector – Similar in principle to viral vector vaccines, but using bacteria instead. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.When increased production of vaccines was urgently needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the World Trade Organization and governments around the world evaluated whether to waive intellectual property rights and patents on COVID-19 vaccines, which would "eliminate all potential barriers to the timely access of affordable COVID-19 medical products, including vaccines and medicines, and scale up the manufacturing and supply of essential medical products". 
 Severity of DAD or more chronic lung damage, clinical history. If there’s no other obvious cause of death in somebody who was admitted for covid, it’s covid. If there was something else like an MI, it’s a question of how severe systemic disease 2/2 covid/long term intubation [SEP] Cognitive impairment is associated with the declining ability to cope with the basic activities of daily living.It is unclear if those with COPD are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, though if infected they are at risk of hospitalization and developing severe COVID-19. Diagnosis
The diagnosis of COPD should be considered in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. Differential diagnosis
COPD may need to be differentiated from other conditions such as congestive heart failure, asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, obliterative bronchiolitis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Previously it has been known by a number of different names, including chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease, chronic airflow obstruction, chronic obstructive lung disease, nonspecific chronic pulmonary disease, diffuse obstructive pulmonary syndrome.The terms emphysema and chronic bronchitis were formally defined as components of COPD in 1959 at the CIBA guest symposium and in 1962 at the American Thoracic Society Committee meeting on Diagnostic Standards.Early descriptions of probable emphysema began in 1679 by T. Bonet of a condition of "voluminous lungs" and in 1769 by Giovanni Morgagni of lungs which were "turgid particularly from air". Infection

Diagnosis
Investigation is tailored towards the symptoms and signs. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) established the criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. "Causes of Death". How the medical profession categorized causes of death. 
 The Covid patient “long haulers” are also very similar to some of us cancer patients. The aftermath of the disease (and for some of us C pts caused by treatment) is very similar. The brain fog, chronic fatigue, pain etc. [SEP] The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to intensive care units (ICU).Between 5% and 50% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID, a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease. 
https://t.co/MUVrI0jkpX Scientists haven’t figured out  #LongCovid. Here are 5 of their best hypotheses. From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #ApresJ20 #CovidLong [SEP] Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. The most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue and memory problems. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms
Long COVID symptoms may involve multiple organs and may be severe. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. See also

The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold. By 30 October 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in Saudi Arabia.After the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre sequenced the virus, the virus was given a new name, Human Coronavirus–Erasmus Medical Centre (HCoV-EMC).

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home or spending more time outdoors, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, wearing a mask in public, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.

 You have a better chance of being hit with lightning then to get a blood clot from a vaccine. Actually Covid can cause a blood clot. [SEP] Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes. In Christianity, the Second Coming of Jesus is compared to lightning. Lightning in a thunderstorm is more likely to strike objects and spots that are more prominent or conductive. Lightning: Physics and effects. On 6 August 1994 a ball lightning is believed to have gone through a closed window in Uppsala, Sweden, leaving a circular hole about 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter. This strengthens the possibility of lightning-induced seizure in the occipital lobe of a person close to a lightning strike, establishing the connection between epileptic hallucination mimicking ball lightning and thunderstorms. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. 
  No people are developing these diseases and dieing as a result of becoming infected with Covid 19 for example people with diabetes getting Covid and dieing of renal failure or young people getting Covid and having a stroke as it causes blood clots eg. https://t.co/AMn7OnXr15 [SEP] The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections. Some diseases, such as most (but not all) forms of cancer, heart disease, and mental disorders, are non-infectious diseases. Heart disease and cancer are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Influenza may make heart attacks and strokes more likely and therefore influenza vaccination may decrease the chance of cardiovascular events and death in people with heart disease.Proper CVD management necessitates a focus on MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle-income levels. Epidemiology
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases each year. 
    Mask wearing as recommended by the CDC does not cause hypoxia. COVID has been clearly associated with higher risk of stroke, though no question a sedentary lifestyle as well. [SEP] Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended because they expel the wearer's breath outwards, and an infected wearer would transmit the virus through the valve. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. In August 2020, the CDC added that exhalation valves or vents in masks do not help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others.In a November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC reiterated their recommendation for the community use of masks and specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In June 2020, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said asymptomatic individuals wearing face masks were not to be recommended due to the low prevalence of COVID-19 in the country but noted that it should be reconsidered if cases rise. (September 2020), which links the seasonality of respiratory viral diseases to decreased air humidity due to indoor heating, argues that mask-wearing helps limit respiratory virus transmission in winter because masks keep the nose warm and moist.Social media claims that masks could reduce the oxygen levels in older people were refuted by a small study of SpO2 levels, the results of which were published by JAMA. In December 2021, a study in PNAS found that when two people wear surgical masks, while the infectious is speaking, the risk of infection remains below 30% after one hour, but when both wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, it is 0.4%.In February 2022, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that surgical masks worn at indoor public venues can reduce the chances of testing positive for COVID-19 by 66%, while tightfitting N95 and KN95 masks can reduce the odds of infection by 83%. However, if the mask includes an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (and possibly asymptomatic) may transmit the virus through the valve. 
 Covid is no joke, this is why we need the vaccine. We know that mRNA doesn't cause long term effects since it decomposes in your body within 1-2 hours. Please everyone, get vaccinated as soon as you can! [SEP] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. A study is investigating the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 provided by the mRNA vaccines. Effectiveness
Duration of immunity
As of 2021, available evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least six months. Acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic required faster production capability of mRNA vaccines, made them attractive to national health organisations, and led to debate about the type of initial authorization mRNA vaccines should get (including emergency use authorization or expanded access authorization) after the eight-week period of post-final human trials. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue.

From 2020 to 2021, Moderna received $955 million from Operation Warp Speed to accelerate development of its COVID-19 vaccine, with $4.9 billion committed in total for producing 300 million vaccine doses.In March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved clinical trials for the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine candidate, and in December, the vaccine, mRNA-1273, was issued an emergency use authorization in the United States. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. 
 6 women out of +6M given. We won't know for a long time their medical history. The problem is that the disease for the vaccine can cause blood clots. So the immune reaction, in extremely rare cases, is blood clots. I still think the vaccine is better than COVID. [SEP] Rare side effects (that occurred in less than 1 in 1,000 people) are hypersensitivity (allergy) and itchy rash.An increased risk of the rare and potentially fatal thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been associated with mainly younger female recipients of the vaccine. This syndrome, marked by formation of blood clots in the blood vessels in combination with low levels of blood platelets 4–28 days after the vaccines administration, occurred at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women aged 18–49 years old and it occurs more rarely in other populations (i.e., women 50 years and older and men of all ages).Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur in rare cases within a few minutes to one hour after receiving a dose.In May 2021, with 7.98 million doses administered, the CDC reported four cases of anaphylaxis after vaccination (none of which resulted in death) and 28 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (of which three resulted in death).In July 2021, the US fact sheet for the vaccine was updated to indicate that there may be an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination. Blood clots
Videos posted to Facebook and Instagram have claimed without evidence that 62 percent of people given an mRNA vaccine develop blood clots, and that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine causes blood to clot "in a minute or two". A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective, it prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. Vaccination campaign responses
Early reports of the events of concern seemed to indicate the presentation rate for the specific blood clots of concern might be higher for women of younger ages, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found examples across all genders and ages, their data skewing towards these specific blood clots being more prevalent in AZD1222 vaccinated persons of younger ages.The WHO has continued to stress the administration of vaccines is based on risk versus benefit analysis. 
 As you can still get covid when vaccinated, it is uncertain whether the vaccine will protect against long covid. Only time will tell on this one. Even a mild case of infection can cause long covid. [SEP] Appearing in a special edition of BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, says that the COVID vaccination programme has prevented around 60,000 deaths from the virus, as well as 22 million cases. A video released by the NHS urging young people to have the vaccine features three people talking about the effects of Long COVID and their personal experiences with the condition. Figures produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate fully vaccinated people are much less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those who are unvaccinated, with only 256 of the 51,000 COVID deaths in England between January and July 2021 occurring in people who had been fully vaccinated. An Oxford University study finds that people can suffer from "long flu" in the same way they can suffer from "Long COVID". A Public Health Scotland report into the February 2020 outbreak of COVID at a Nike conference in Edinburgh finds it did not lead to community transmission of the virus. Research published by the University of Edinburgh indicates that COVID vaccination is 90% effective at preventing death from the disease. 17 November
The vaccination advice for children aged 12–17 is updated, with the new recommendation that they should wait twelve weeks to get vaccinated following a COVID infection; previously the advice had been to wait four weeks. Data produced by Imperial College London indicates that a single dose of COVID vaccine is 56% effective at preventing children from catching the virus. 
   This whole vaccine thing is nuts. This vaccine has the potential to cause huge issues whereas catching it and recovery is less of a health risk. Plus the medications that work well to fight covid but no..let’s push this vaccine mandate. Good luck to those that get it. [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms. Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation, and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.

The fact that we haven't found myocarditis with CMR in the hearts of asymptomatic, otherwise healthy athletes Doesn't mean that a *symptomatic* Long Covid patient cannot have myopericarditis  As seen w/ vaccine side effects in the young, just the S-protein by itself can cause it [SEP] Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. When looking at different causes of myocarditis, viral infection is the most prevalent, especially in children; however, the prevalence rate of myocarditis is often underestimated as the condition is easily overlooked and is sometimes asymptomatic. Myocarditis and COVID-19
Myocarditis can be seen during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; with the myocarditis being associated with a spectrum of severities from asymptomatic to fulminant. Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. When looking at different causes of myocarditis, viral infection is the most prevalent, especially in children; however, the prevalence rate of myocarditis is often underestimated as the condition is easily overlooked and is sometimes asymptomatic.

Canadian Disasters: an historical survey by Robert L. Jones A week later, on 11 March, the government announced a CA$1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund that included a $50 million contribution to the World Health Organization and an additional $275 million to fund coronavirus research in Canada.On 13 March, the Bank of Canada lowered the overnight rate target by 50 basis points to 0.75 percent in an unscheduled rate decision citing the "negative shocks to Canada's economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices."

The COVID-19 pandemic in Newfoundland and Labrador is ongoing. Health orders, including the closure of non-essential businesses, and mandatory self-isolation for all travellers entering the province (including from within Canada) were enacted over the days that followed.As of February 5, 2022, there have been 18,464 recorded cases of persons testing positive for the virus, including forty-six deaths. On 17 March 2020, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney declares public health emergency for COVID-19. On 14 March 2020, Quebec Premier Francois Legault declares public health emergency for COVID-19. 
  They have known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem.   Why haven’t they paused those, too? https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] Authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. In mid-May 2021, UNICEF was also critical of the fact that most proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early in 2022.In July 2021, the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization said in a joint statement: "As many countries are struggling with new variants, and a third wave of COVID‑19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth. Liability
Several governments agreed to shield pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna from negligence claims related to COVID‑19 vaccines (and treatments), as in previous pandemics, when governments also took on liability for such claims. On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two-thirds for this variant, while stating that no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made. There have been a number of reasons expressed why people might not wish to take COVID-19 vaccines, such as concerns over safety, self-perception of being "low risk", or questioning the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in particular. In February 2022, Johnson & Johnson announced it has temporarily suspended production of the vaccine though they also noted that it will likely resume at some point in the future and that it will honor all pre-existing contracts that oblige Janssen to supply its vaccine by using the millions of already existing vaccine doses in its inventory where requested. The trial was paused in October 2020, because a volunteer became ill, but the company said it found no evidence that the vaccine had caused the illness and announced in October 2020 that it would resume the trial. In April 2021, South Africa suspended its rollout of the vaccine. 
  CoVID 19 is known to create blood clotting & thickening. Your kidneys are a filter for your blood so when this happens your blood literally clogs your kidneys and causes kidney failure.  Many CoVID patients are on renal meds or dialysis. I am so sorry for your loss! This is real! [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. People with acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the crush syndrome, when large amounts of toxins are suddenly released in the blood circulation after a long compressed limb is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing ischemia. The resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys. 
  1.) They take away the most important part of our communication: mimic and body language in general. 2.) The humid, warm environment behind the masks can cause bacterial pneumonia, which in turn can lead to Corona disease. 1/2 [SEP] The lack of communicative competence, on the other hand, can cause problems both on the individual and the societal level, including professional, academic, and health problems. This may result in failed communication and cause undesirable effects. Mimicry can result in an evolutionary arms race if mimicry negatively affects the model, and the model can evolve a different appearance from the mimic.p161 Mimicry should not be confused with other forms of convergent evolution that occurs when species come to resemble each other by adapting to similar lifestyles that have nothing to do with a common signal receiver. Breathing
Body language related to breathing and patterns of breathing can be indicative of a person's mood and state of mind; because of this, the relationship between body language and breathing is often considered in contexts such as business meetings and presentations. What you communicate through your body language and nonverbal signals affects how others see you, how well they like and respect you, and whether or not they trust you. Tone of voice
The body also has a massive effect on our breathing pattern which in turn has a massive effect on the way the words are spoken. For instance, if someone is speaking while sitting in a chair with a hunched back, then this obstructs the breathing system, including the throat, and may muffle the tone of voice and convey the impression of being deenergised, unhappy or bored. The communicative feature is the ability of body language to create an environment and atmosphere that is able to facilitate effective learning. 
 I'm not trying to make comparisons, I'm trying to point out that saying the vaccine can cause serious side effects is a bit hypocritical coming from a guy who's been trivialising covid all year when many of us have had long term illness from that. I wasn't trying to cause offence [SEP] In regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, he has accused his political opponents of exaggerating the severity of the virus. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case for prescription drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. For example, although vaccination may trigger some side effects, the effects experienced from an infection could be worse. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. Economics

Fighting stigma —  Covid-19 Impact On Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Market 2020, SWOT Analysis, New ...: Alzheimer's disease is a condition most common in people of 65 years or above age. This disease causes confusing reactions like the confusion ... https://t.co/sFZNcRossl [SEP] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. In the United States in 2020, Alzheimer's dementia prevalence was estimated to be 5.3% for those in the 60–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 13.8% in the 74–84 group and to 34.6% in those greater than 85. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, now known as the Alzheimer's Association) established the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. Society and culture
Social costs
Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for societies worldwide. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), also called Younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD), is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed before the age of 65. Familial and nonfamilial Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia; it usually occurs in old age. With some jobs, a mistake may have devastating consequences on a large number of people, and cases have been reported in which a person with early-onset Alzheimer's who is unaware of their condition has caused distress.Younger people with Alzheimer's may also lose their ability to take care of their own needs, such as money management.It has been suggested that conceptualizations of Alzheimer's and ageing should resist the notion that there are two distinct conditions. 
And any other virus, disease. Apparently this has been the first year with zero deaths of heart disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer. All deaths were caused by covid.🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/GIoqfeaWNR [SEP] Without these restrictions, more people will develop COVID-19. Not just this year, but every year." ".Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health of Alberta, said that the declaration would lead to increased deaths, hospitalizations and cases of Long COVID. Commenting on the fact that 20 per cent of people killed by COVID-19 have been people aged under 65, and that about a third of recovered COVID-19 patients, including young patients, continue to have symptoms weeks after their infection, Nabarro said it was "amazingly irresponsible" not to take these risks into consideration.Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University, described the strategy proposed by the declaration as "culling the herd of the sick and disabled", calling it "grotesque". Firstly, it says nothing about harm suffered by people in low-risk groups, even though a significant number of patients who recover from COVID-19, including people who experience no symptoms, have been shown to have heart and lung damage. Gupta said that "the alternative [to herd immunity], which is to keep suppressing the virus, comes at an enormous cost to the poor and to the young and not just in this country [the United States] but worldwide", arguing that the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 will be reached in December 2020.

Maybe mRNA vaccines caused rare heart inflammation in some teens. "The CDC hasn’t determined if there’s really a link to the shots, and continues to urge that everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against Covid-19, which is far riskier than the vaccine." https://t.co/RH3rquGcMV [SEP] The mRNA strands in the vaccine may elicit an unintended immune reaction – this entails the body believing itself to be sick, and the person feeling as if they are as a result. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue. The reason for the efficacy of the new mRNA vaccines is not clear.Physician-scientist Margaret Liu stated that the efficacy of the new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could be due to the "sheer volume of resources" that went into development, or that the vaccines might be "triggering a nonspecific inflammatory response to the mRNA that could be heightening its specific immune response, given that the modified nucleoside technique reduced inflammation but hasn't eliminated it completely", and that "this may also explain the intense reactions such as aches and fevers reported in some recipients of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines". Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The FDA and European Medicines Agency estimates the risk of myocarditis after the Covid-19 vaccine as 1 case per 100,000 of those who are vaccinated. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 vaccination was observed to be highest in males between 16–29 years of age, and after receiving the second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/0PhwEKpCBR [SEP] Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure (after the barometer),    is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa (1,013.25 hPa), which is equivalent to 1,013.25 millibars, 760 mm Hg, 29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi. The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth; that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm. This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the Internet. Surface pressure
Surface pressure is the atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth's surface (terrain and oceans). The average pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is 1,013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure. Pressure comfort: the comfort of the human body's pressure receptors' (present in the skin) sensory response towards clothing. 
 I received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and had side effects with a fever. That side effect is also cause to self isolate and get a Covid test as per the screening tool and Health Links.  What should people having vaccine side effects do? [SEP] COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Adverse effects
The most common side effects in the clinical trials were usually mild or moderate and got better within a few days after vaccination.Vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, swelling, redness at the injection site and low levels of blood platelets occurred in less than 1 in 10 people. Enlarged lymph nodes, decreased appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, abdominal pain, itching and rash occurred in less than 1 in 100 people.An increased risk of the rare and potentially fatal thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been associated with mainly younger female recipients of the vaccine. Analysis of VigiBase reported embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, found a temporally related incidence of 0.21 cases per 1 million vaccinated-days.Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are known side effects of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has assessed 41 cases of anaphylaxis from around 5 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom.Capillary leak syndrome is a possible side effect of the vaccine.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) listed Guillain-Barré syndrome as a very rare side effect of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and added a warning in the product information.Additional side effects include tinnitus (persistent ringing in the ears), paraesthesia (unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation), and hypoaesthesia (decreased feeling or sensitivity, especially in the skin). The first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 94% for COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28–34 days post-vaccination. The EMA also stressed that the benefits of AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of possible side effects. Side effects include allergic dermatitis and hay fever. 
some insight, covid-19 is the name of the disease, not the virus. the virus' name is SARS-CoV 2. just like how HIV is the name of the virus that causes AIDS, and rubeola the virus that causes the measles :D [SEP] Measles is the most contagious virus known. According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered vaccination campaigns in at least 68 countries, including in countries that were experiencing outbreaks, which caused increased risk of additional cases. Like smallpox, some viral diseases might be conquered, but new ones, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), will continue to emerge. This was hepatitis B virus, which was named after the disease it causes. SARS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a new type of coronavirus. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.A related coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. Subsequently, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, infections with the virus caused a pandemic with a case fatality rate of around 2% in healthy people under the age of 50, to around 15% in those aged over 80 particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities. The fatality rate was lower than SARS but the infection was more contagious. 
  It actually is worse than the corona virus that causes the common cold. https://t.co/nlukW9crPA [SEP] One origin hypothesis is that various mutations in the Omicron variant, comprising a 9-nucleotide sequence, may have been acquired from another coronavirus (known as HCoV-229E), responsible for the common cold. A study performed between 1 and 7 December 2021 by the Center for Disease Control found that: "The most commonly reported symptoms [were] cough, fatigue, and congestion or runny nose" making it difficult to distinguish from a less damaging variant or another virus. Research published in London on 25 December 2021 suggested the most frequent symptoms stated by users of the Zoe Covid app were "a runny nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats.

   Lots of things can cause heart failure. Could be hereditary.  Could be stress, diet or all of the above. There is no conclusive evidence that COVID alone causes heart failure in healthy people. [SEP] Chest pain, including angina, is not usually caused by heart failure, but may occur if the heart failure was caused by a heart attack. Other conditions that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy. : 3612  Heart failure is the potential end stage of all heart diseases.Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. : e279 : Table 5  In addition, viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. If more than one cause is present, progression is more likely and prognosis is worse.Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab and substance use disorders of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Pathophysiology
Heart failure is caused by any condition that reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life. 
   The vast majority had conditions such as respiratory failure, blood clots and stroke, which can be caused by the coronavirus itself. Others had underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, sepsis and diabetes, possibly preexisting conditions [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZOGcpcSLOe [SEP] Cause
Several types of conditions can potentially result in respiratory failure:

Conditions that reduce the flow of air into and out of the lungs, including physical obstruction by foreign bodies or masses and reduced breathing due to drugs or changes to the chest. Conditions that impair the lungs' blood supply. pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage). If rapid blood circulation (e.g., because of tachycardia) occurs within vessels that have endothelial injuries, that creates disordered flow (turbulence) that can lead to the formation of thrombosis;Common causes of stasis include anything that leads to prolonged immobility and reduced blood flow such as: trauma/broken bones and extended air travel. Causes are septicaemia, acute leukaemia, shock, snake bites, fat emboli from broken bones, or other severe traumas. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. The study also recognized that because of overcrowded conditions in all the participating hospitals during the crisis, the immediate care –  which is critical –  was not as comprehensive as it should have been.In rare cases, brain damage has been reported as a permanent sequela of severe heat stroke, most commonly cerebellar atrophy. 
      Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Info from Mayo Clinic [SEP] These symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.The life expectancy of people with PD is reduced. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.The biggest risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. A brainstem stroke affecting the brainstem and brain, therefore, can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:
altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial)
drooping of eyelid (ptosis) and weakness of ocular muscles
decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light
decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face
balance problems and nystagmus
altered breathing and heart rate
weakness in sternocleidomastoid muscle with inability to turn head to one side
weakness in tongue (inability to stick out the tongue or move it from side to side)If the cerebral cortex is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but can also produce the following symptoms:

aphasia (difficulty with verbal expression, auditory comprehension, reading and writing; Broca's or Wernicke's area typically involved)
dysarthria (motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury)
apraxia (altered voluntary movements)
visual field defect
memory deficits (involvement of temporal lobe)
hemineglect (involvement of parietal lobe)
disorganized thinking, confusion, hypersexual gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe)
lack of insight of his or her, usually stroke-related, disabilityIf the cerebellum is involved, ataxia might be present and this includes:

altered walking gait
altered movement coordination
vertigo and or disequilibrium

Associated symptoms
Loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occur more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still damages the brain and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. There may be benefit in high intensity and high doses over a longer period, but these higher intensity doses may not be acceptable to everyone.People who have had a stroke may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. Physical effects
Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss and pain.

A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance. At the same time, a Hearst Newspapers investigation concluded that up to 200,000 people per year die from medical errors and infections in the United States.

 I want to know why long covid can get immediate recognition and treatment....an infection that can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Just like PANS and PANDAS! Yet, PANS PANDAS families are being hurled into the pits of neglect by your dangerous consensus statement [SEP] Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of conditions characterized by long-term, multi-system, often severe health problems persisting or appearing after the typical recovery period of COVID-19. Terminology and definitions
Overview
Long COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London. One rule of thumb is that long COVID represents symptoms that have been present for longer than two months, though there is no reason to believe that this choice of cutoff is specific to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) term Post-Covid Conditions qualifies long covid as symptoms four or more weeks after first infection. Long COVID was identified more in those cared for intensive care unit during the acute illness phase, children younger than five years, and those with complex chronic conditions. Dysautonomia and POTS are also potential aspects of long COVID. Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long COVID—A Practical Guide. A review of what is known about long COVID by the NIHR

Some of the severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 seem to result from the activity of specific immune cells, which can cause long-term inflammation of the lungs. [SEP] Infection causes generalized inflammation within the lungs, including the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells (such as monocytes and T-cells), necrosis of the epithelial cell wall, edema, and increased mucous production. Respiratory
Cough is another typical symptom of COVID-19, which could be either dry or a productive cough.Some symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are more common in patients who need hospital care. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. 
  Interesting thing about Covid is that it can cause pneumonia, where as pneumonia doesn't cause Covid. [SEP] A test confirmed her diagnosis as COVID-positive. He contrasted COVID-19's mortality rate with that of Ebola, stating: "This is a flu. The quote was made public on September 9, a few days in advance of the scheduled release of Woodward's book, Rage.Trump has repeatedly compared COVID-19 to influenza, despite Fauci estimating COVID-19 to have a mortality rate around ten times higher. "At the April 10 briefing with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Trump implied that the illness was caused by a bacterial pathogen rather than a virus: "Antibiotics used to solve every problem. COVID-19 emerged during Trump's presidency, at the end of 2019. "COVID", he observed. It was reported that he had a common head cold and he reportedly tested negative for both COVID-19 and pneumonia, as well as the flu. COVID-19 misinformation – multiple theories proposing a wide variety of different things regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 itself and COVID-19 vaccines. 
Why was handcock pumping this into Covid patients![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Midazolam injection may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems such as shallow, slowed, or temporarily stopped breathing that may lead to permanent brain injury or death? [SEP] Symptoms and signs
Complications
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects." An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and amphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. 
Apparently COVID can cause hair loss...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So that’s cool... [SEP] Hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body. The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. Hair loss is a common problem. Some treatments used to cure mycotic infections can cause massive hair loss. Not all users will regrow hair. Research
Research is looking into connections between hair loss and other health issues. It is the most common cause of hair loss. Interleukin 1 is suspected to be a cytokine mediator that promotes hair loss.The fact that hair loss is cumulative with age while androgen levels fall as well as the fact that finasteride does not reverse advanced stages of androgenetic alopecia remains a mystery, but possible explanations are higher conversion of testosterone to DHT locally with age as higher levels of 5-alpha reductase are noted in balding scalp, and higher levels of DNA damage in the dermal papilla as well as senescence of the dermal papilla due to androgen receptor activation and environmental stress. 
#Neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia increase the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and dying from the disease. For people with Alzheimer's the risk is three times greater. It can be six times greater if they are over 80 https://t.co/sxQ21lyfhu #science [SEP] Within neurodegenerative diseases, it is estimated that 55 million people worldwide had dementia in 2019, and that by 2050 this figure will increase to 139 million people. The greatest risk factor for developing dementia is aging, however dementia is not a normal part of aging. Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60–70% of cases of dementia worldwide. Prevention
Risk factors
A 2020 review increased the number of associated risk factors for dementia; risks of over-indulgence in alcohol, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution were added to lower levels of education, high blood pressure, hearing loss, smoking, obesity, depression, inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact. Around 7% of people over aged 65 have dementia, with slightly higher rates (up to 10% of those over 65) in places with relatively high life expectancy. The incidence of dementia increases exponentially with age, doubling with every 6.3-year increase in age. Affected ages
About 3% of people between the ages of 65–74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84, and nearly half of those over 85 years of age. As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common. 
 There are studies that address that. Look up Fibromyalgia & MD in Newton, Ma. I don't go along w/his tx regimen, but he championed that, 'of course chronic illness can CAUSE depression/anxiety' & had been proven(some classic Minnesota study).Also, HCPs doubting your sick contribs [SEP] Fibromyalgia is associated with mental health issues like anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, alexithymia, and depression. Patients with fibromyalgia are five times more likely to have major depression than the general population.Fibromyalgia and numerous chronic pain conditions frequently coexist. In these vulnerable individuals, psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways that regulate mood and pain. Stress
Stress may be an important precipitating factor in the development of fibromyalgia. A 2021 meta-analysis found psychological trauma to be strongly associated with fibromyalgia. Immune system
Inflammation has been suggested to have a role in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia. A 2021 meta-analysis concluded that antidepressants can improve the quality of life for fibromyalgia patients in the medium-term. Effect sizes tend to be small when cognitive behavioral therapy is used as a stand-alone treatment for patients with fibromyalgia, but these improve significantly when it is part of a wider multidisciplinary treatment program.A 2010 systematic review of 14 studies reported that cognitive behavioral therapy improves self-efficacy or coping with pain and reduces the number of physician visits at post-treatment, but has no significant effect on pain, fatigue, sleep, or health-related quality of life at post-treatment or follow-up. 
     There's a really fact based answer for that. And the covid vaccine trials started in April 2020. So it's been over a year. And mRNA vaccines can't cause autoimmune diseases (although they may be dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases.) [SEP] Over the next few years, clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for a number of other viruses were started. mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for infectious agents such as influenza, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.In March 2022 Moderna announced the development of mRNA vaccines for 15 diseases: Chikungunya virus, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Dengue, Ebola virus disease, HIV, Malaria, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome, Tuberculosis and Zika. Acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines. However, those susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to mRNA vaccines. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue. The reason for the efficacy of the new mRNA vaccines is not clear.Physician-scientist Margaret Liu stated that the efficacy of the new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could be due to the "sheer volume of resources" that went into development, or that the vaccines might be "triggering a nonspecific inflammatory response to the mRNA that could be heightening its specific immune response, given that the modified nucleoside technique reduced inflammation but hasn't eliminated it completely", and that "this may also explain the intense reactions such as aches and fevers reported in some recipients of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines". "The tangled history of mRNA vaccines". "Understanding mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines". 
  That's not true at all. Overlooking the fact that western medicine tends to treat symptoms not causes, the Covid vaccine, like all vaccines, work by helping your body identify the virus & create antibodies to protect you from infection. Your comments do nothing but spread fear. [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccines
A COVID-19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic and severe illness. The COVID-19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID-19.As of March 2023, more than 5.5 billion people had received one or more doses (11.8 billion in total) in over 197 countries. According to a June 2022 study, COVID-19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 million to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.On 8 November 2022, the first recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax's booster Nuvaxovid) was authorized for use in adults in the United Kingdom. The report indicated that "inequitable distribution is not unique to COVID-19 vaccines"; countries that are not economically strong struggle to obtain vaccines.On 14 November 2022, the first inhalable vaccine was introduced, developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics, in the city of Shanghai, China. In the United States, COVID-19 vaccines became available under emergency use in December 2020, beginning the national vaccination program. The first COVID-19 vaccine was officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 23 August 2021. 
There are hints that pple who have serious COVID-19 mount the strongest responses, just as in the 2 other serious human diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe  SARS & MERS Both trigger high antibody levels that last up to 2 years, & T cell responses to SARS can be detected even [SEP] MERS-CoV is one of several viruses identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a likely cause of a future epidemic. Virology
The virus MERS-CoV is a member of the beta group of coronavirus, Betacoronavirus, lineage C. MERS-CoV genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades, clade A and B. The earliest cases were of clade A clusters, while the majority of more recent cases are of the genetically distinct clade B.MERS-CoV is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans, including
HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-HKU1, the original
SARS-CoV (or SARS-CoV-1), and SARS-CoV-2. However the major natural reservoir where humans get the virus infection remained unknown until on 9 August 2013, a report in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases showed that 50 out of 50 (100%) blood serum from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14%) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against the MERS-CoV spike protein. The theoretical virus could also have a high mortality burden, since MERS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 35%. measures of "early investigation and outbreak preparedness" and, according to the study, would have been capable of predicting SARS-CoV-2 as a high-risk strain without prior knowledge of zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.An artificial "global immune system"-like technological system that includes pathogen detection may be able to substantially reduce the time required to take on a biothreat agent. Mutation surveillance
In December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, national and international officials reported mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2, including some with higher transmissibility and worldwide spread. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escaped the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, including of sera from vaccinated and convalescent individuals. 
 You literally missed the point of everything I said. Mild infections will not cause long term lung damage. That’s it. Infections, viral or otherwise, causing vasculitis and thrombosis, is nothing new. Only thing new is greater % of severe infections with Covid19. [SEP] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. After severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels.The risks of cognitive deficit, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and amphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. Early infection tends to be associated with mild or no symptoms, while the later pulmonary phase, which can be life-threatening in adults, is usually mild or absent. Association of Kawasaki-like disease with COVID-19 could support the view that SARS-CoV-2 can cause systemic vasculitis by targeting endothelial tissue via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the protein which the virus uses to gain access to cells. Other diseases
Several other diseases that cause inflammation of the lung increase one's risk of lung cancer. Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high.

We may see a flood of patients with memory loss or even #Alzheimers in a few years; #COVID19 can cause major problems in the brain that look similar to #TBI or #Alzheimers disease.  https://t.co/fhtlPKk9yg [SEP] Aging
One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Memory dysfunction can also occur after viral infections. Many patients recovering from COVID-19 experience memory lapses. Other viruses can also elicit memory dysfunction, including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus and even influenza virus. Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large, with an estimated global annual cost of US$1 trillion. As the disease progresses so does the degree of memory impairment. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.Life expectancy of people with Alzheimer's disease is reduced. The cost to society worldwide to care for individuals with AD is projected to increase nearly ten-fold, and reach about US$9.1 trillion by 2050.Costs for those with more severe dementia or behavioral disturbances are higher and are related to the additional caregiving time to provide physical care. 
‘Covid infection can cause liver damage’ https://t.co/bbxcfViujg [SEP] Long COVID and Kidney Disease
Yende & Parikh 2021 talk about the effects that COVID can have on a person that has a pre-existing health issue regarding kidney diseases. "frailty, chronic diseases, disability and immunodeficiency are at increased risk of kidney disease and progression to kidney failure, and infection with SARS-CoV-2 can further increase this risk" (Long COVID and Kidney Disease, 2021). Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of blood clots and a prolonged recovery. "Current trends in live liver donation". Sepsis can cause liver, kidney and heart damage. Complications may include liver failure. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.

Yo, why would a vaccine that creates spike proteins smooth muscle contractions cause the kidney to start releasing large amounts of blood clotting compounds in susceptible people? Must be the adenovirus. https://t.co/AvxlcaEDFv  oh https://t.co/A1S4YrLGcP https://t.co/rq8kOxTWhP [SEP] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection, since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses. When introduced into human tissue, the vaccine contains either self-replicating RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), which both cause cells to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). Controversy

"Coronavirus vaccine – weekly summary of Yellow Card reporting". A non-contractile function is seen in specialized smooth muscle within the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which secretes renin in response to osmotic and pressure changes, and also it is believed to secrete ATP in tubuloglomerular regulation of glomerular filtration rate. 
Based on few articles, that comparison is incorrect, because covid causes clots in the brain (Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: CVST), while birth control pills cause clots in the legs that travel to the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism) & those are treatable with anticoagulants. [SEP] Microclots have been found to be a characteristic feature in severe cases of COVID-19, and in long COVID.Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a large blood vessel or heart chamber. Prevention
Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent the formation of blood clots, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack and pulmonary embolism. Heparin and warfarin are used to inhibit the formation and growth of existing thrombi, with the former used for acute anticoagulation while the latter is used for long-term anticoagulation. The mechanism of action of heparin and warfarin are different as they work on different pathways of the coagulation cascade. In contrast, warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme needed to synthesize vitamin K dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Abnormalities can lead to an increased tendency toward thrombosis:

Protein C
Protein C is a major physiological anticoagulant. Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents are amongst the most commonly used medications. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are the most commonly used. 
 Yeah. & I don’t think they don’t have a Covid vaccine for babies yet so I definitely wouldn’t put it in my body while pregnant. Cause you really don’t even know they effect it’s gonna have on you either. I got mine the other day tho. No side effects except for a sore arm. [SEP] COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. The highest concentration of nanoparticles was found at the injection site itself.COVID‑19 vaccination is safe for breastfeeding people. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Pfizer and BioNTech announced on 18 February 2021 that the first participants received their first dose in this trial.A study published in March 2021, in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology came to the conclusion that messenger RNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were safe and effective at providing immunity against infection to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. In addition, the study reported that the occurrence and intensity of potential side effects in those undergoing pregnancy or lactating was very similar to those expected from non-pregnant populations, remaining generally very minor and well tolerated, mostly including injection site soreness, minor headaches, muscles aches or fatigue for a short period of time.In January 2021, Pfizer said it had finished enrolling 2,259 children aged between 12 and 15 years to study the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

InfoWars disseminates multiple conspiracy theories, including false claims against the HPV vaccine and claims the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was part of a conspiracy. Jones frequently uses InfoWars to assert that mass shootings are conspiracies or "false flag" operations; these false claims are often subsequently spread by other fake news outlets and on social media. (Biggs was later indicted for seditious conspiracy for his role with the Proud Boys in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.) Claims of false flag school shootings
InfoWars has regularly claimed, without evidence, that mass shootings have been staged "false flag" operations and has accused survivors of such events of being crisis actors employed by the United States government. A significant portion of InfoWars's products contain colloidal silver, which Jones falsely claimed "kills every virus", including "the whole SARS-corona family"; this claim was disputed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).A lesser source of revenue for InfoWars is its "money bomb" telethons, which resemble public radio fundraisers, except InfoWars is a for-profit institution. 
   The cytokines released in severe COVID can cross the BBB & cause inflammation. The “happy hypoxia” has neuro implications. The cytokine storm can also cause clots. Again, the mechanism of cell entry is identical to SARS 1. And I can’t find any info that SARS 1 did this. [SEP] Current data suggest cytokine storms may be the source of extensive lung tissue damage and dysfunctional coagulation in COVID-19 infections. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune system resulting in a release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6, which can increase vascular permeability and cause a migration of fluid and blood cells into the alveoli leading to such consequent symptoms as dyspnea and respiratory failure. A cytokine plasma level analysis showed that in cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the levels of many interleukins and cytokines are highly elevated, indicating evidence of a cytokine storm. Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Pathophysiology
The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm
A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. 
 Same with me and my siblings, but in our case it's long term illnesseses that cause compromised immune systems, in fact my brother is on immune suppressants due to a rare auto immune disease, so for us the risks of COVID are far worse than potential side effects of the vaccine. [SEP] This means that sibling warmth does not counteract these negative effects. Dysfunction of the immune system can cause autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen. A 2011 United States Institute of Medicine report stated that "outcomes related to ... immune functioning and autoimmune disorders, and infections ... could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting. Vaccination
Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.Many vaccines are based on acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. 
   A mortality rate under 1% from a vaccine is still a stunning success. Of course people may die from it, but those cases are far and few between and a much lesser toll than untreated covid will cause. The scales aren’t even close to equal. [SEP] Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. Viral vector vaccines were also developed for the COVID‑19 pandemic after the technology was previously cleared for Ebola.As multiple COVID‑19 vaccines have been authorized or licensed for use, real-world vaccine effectiveness (RWE) is being assessed using case control and observational studies. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. 
 Thanks for linking this and telling some of your story. 💜 I've dealt with chronic illness most of my adult life. My biggest worry about COVID-19, and not just for myself, is the long-term effects it's going to cause. Few people understand how drastically it can change your life. [SEP] Consequently, through this process, belief and expectation can set off a chain reaction in the body that can make recovery from chronic illness more likely. A sense of hopelessness during the recovery period has, in many instances, resulted in adverse health conditions for the patient (i.e. A person’s hope (even when facing an illness that will likely end their life) can be helpful by finding joy or comfort. chronic illness vs. terminal illness). The Sickness Unto Death. At its start, the epidemic was particularly severe in the United States. In recent years, independent news sources have shown that working-class Black and Latino gay men in the United States still face significant health disparities in these crises; however, in the United States, as in other places around the world, these problems have only worsened as HIV-positive MSM (especially those from already disadvantaged communities) have been severely and disproportionately affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to HIV, young gay, bisexual, and other MSM are also at significantly higher risk for other sexual health-related issues. Finally, HIV-positive status continues to have a major impact on the mental health of many gay and bisexual men, who fear disclosing their status to employers, friends, and families, particularly if they have not yet come out. 
The virus seems to cause two kinds of lung disease + blood disease. Young people are having strokes. Young people who had light cases may be developing new syndromes of dangerous illness. #COVID is the Swiss army knife of viruses, can & will do anything to anybody. https://t.co/Nj7UA6jvma [SEP] Other coronaviruses are known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of SARS infections—that by July 2003 had caused around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths—was unexpected and most countries were not prepared.A related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), thought to have originated in bats, emerged in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. Infections with the virus caused the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, influenza, and pharyngitis to life-threatening diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis, acute asthma, lung cancer, and severe acute respiratory syndromes, such as COVID-19. This causes chronic respiratory infections, cough, and nasal congestion. This can lead to bronchiectasis, which can cause life-threatening breathing issues. Pulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation and damage to capillaries in the lung resulting in blood leaking into the alveoli. It can present widely from a mild respiratory infection to respiratory failure. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.The biggest risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. 
 There are are over 1000 Covid cases in East Lansing.  The virus can cause cardiac inflammation. Anyone else think this is just a really stupid idea? [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is sometimes referred to as the "coronavirus pandemic" despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. In the United States, COVID-19 vaccines became available under emergency use in December 2020, beginning the national vaccination program. See also

The FDA and European Medicines Agency estimates the risk of myocarditis after the Covid-19 vaccine as 1 case per 100,000 of those who are vaccinated. Other estimates of the incidence of myocarditis in those with COVID-19 range from 2.4 cases of definite/probable myocarditis (based on clinical criteria) per 1,000 people with COVID-19 to 4.1 cases per 1,000 persons in those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.Although myocarditis is relatively rare in those with COVID-19, when it is present it is likely to follow a severe and fulminant course for those previously hospitalized with COVID-19.

If more than one cause is present, progression is more likely and prognosis is worse.Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab and substance use disorders of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life. Although some people survive many years, progressive disease is associated with an overall annual mortality rate of 10%.Around 18 of every 1000 persons will experience an ischemic stroke during the first year after diagnosis of HF. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65. 
 They are both are Coronaviruses that are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections. Rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak can be lethal. [SEP] Coronaviruses
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1). A new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, which was declared as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.Some coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether. Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past:
Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), β-CoV
Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), β-CoV
Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), α-CoV
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), α-CoV–Three human coronaviruses produce potentially severe symptoms:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2003)
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2012)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), β-CoV (identified in 2019)These cause the diseases commonly called SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 respectively. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
In September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These "emergent" viruses are usually mutants of less harmful viruses that have circulated previously either in humans or other animals.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)  are caused by new types of coronaviruses. 
    If you get vaccinated you can fight of infection as if you get normal cold. As your immune already knows the threat the effect of virus will be mild. In case you dont get vaccine..your immune takes time to identify virus(covid turns to pneumonia fast) which may cause serious prob [SEP] A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. In some cases vaccines may result in partial immune protection (in which immunity is less than 100% effective but still reduces risk of infection) or in temporary immune protection (in which immunity wanes over time) rather than full or permanent immunity. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals, and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.At least 19 countries have no-fault compensation programs to provide compensation for those with severe adverse effects of vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. 
 Covid19 contains 4 spike proteins found in hiv. The cause of Covid 19 is from the twins that were genetically altered to be immune to hiv.  They contracted a coronavirus that exploited their resistance to hiv, and mutated to covid19 [SEP] Antibodies targeting the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein are found to neutralise multiple coronavirus variants. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The variant, later named Alpha, showed changes to the spike protein that could make the virus more infectious. 
Peripheral neuropathy hurts, I know firsthand via a motor-sensory stroke.  The CoVID vaccine DOES cause the fingers to ache -- my weakest finger aches now; it was the thumb a week ago.  But it's NOTHING like the CPSP pain, at all!   It's a sore pain (how I notice the difference). [SEP] Peripheral neuropathy may be acute (with sudden onset, rapid progress) or chronic (symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly), and may be reversible or permanent. The term "peripheral neuropathy" sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. These include soreness, redness, rash, and inflammation at the injection site. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The most common include mild to moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headaches.

             Misunderstanding of nicotine is profoundly bad.  A recent Rutgers U. study found 80% of US doctors think it causes cancer.  It does not.  Nicotine MAY reduce #COVID19 risks; DEFINITELY reduces Parkinson's disease risk 30-60%; MAY reduce Alzheimer's; DEFINITELY reduces weight... [SEP] Animal studies suggest that nicotine may adversely affect cognitive development in adolescence, but the relevance of these findings to human brain development is disputed. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, "nicotine is not generally considered to be a carcinogen." 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum also increase the chances of success.Nicotine is being researched in clinical trials for possible benefit in treating Parkinson's disease, dementia, ADHD, depression and sarcoma.In contrast to recreational nicotine products, which have been designed to maximize the likelihood of addiction, nicotine replacement products (NRTs) are designed to minimize addictiveness. A 2010 meta-analysis of 41 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concluded that nicotine or smoking had significant positive effects on aspects of fine motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. Cancer
Although nicotine itself does not cause cancer in humans, it is unclear whether it functions as a tumor promoter as of 2012. A 2018 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concludes, "[w]hile it is biologically plausible that nicotine can act as a tumor promoter, the existing body of evidence indicates this is unlikely to translate into increased risk of human cancer. The majority of research shows that nicotine reduces body weight, but some researchers have found that nicotine may result in weight gain under specific types of eating habits in animal models. Research
Central nervous system
While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of neuronal nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitization of those receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of major depressive disorder in non-smokers.Though tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, there is evidence that nicotine itself has the potential to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.Smoking is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's Disease; however, it is unknown whether this is due to people with healthier brain dopaminergic reward centers (the area of the brain affected by Parkinson's) being more likely to enjoy smoking and thus pick up the habit, nicotine directly acting as a neuroprotective agent, or other compounds in cigarette smoke acting as neuroprotective agents. 
 The FDA has known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem. Why haven’t they paused those, too?  https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] Authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. In mid-May 2021, UNICEF was also critical of the fact that most proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early in 2022.In July 2021, the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization said in a joint statement: "As many countries are struggling with new variants, and a third wave of COVID‑19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth. Liability
Several governments agreed to shield pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna from negligence claims related to COVID‑19 vaccines (and treatments), as in previous pandemics, when governments also took on liability for such claims. On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two-thirds for this variant, while stating that no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made. In February 2022, Johnson & Johnson announced it has temporarily suspended production of the vaccine though they also noted that it will likely resume at some point in the future and that it will honor all pre-existing contracts that oblige Janssen to supply its vaccine by using the millions of already existing vaccine doses in its inventory where requested. Tinnitus was later labeled as "very rare" in a final safety study by the manufacturer.In December 2021, the CDC accepted the recommendation from a panel of experts for a preference of using the Pfizer-BioNech and Moderna vaccines over the Janssen vaccine due to rare but serious blood clotting events. The trial was paused in October 2020, because a volunteer became ill, but the company said it found no evidence that the vaccine had caused the illness and announced in October 2020 that it would resume the trial. There have been a number of reasons expressed why people might not wish to take COVID-19 vaccines, such as concerns over safety, self-perception of being "low risk", or questioning the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in particular. 
  Steady on.  Covid (particularly the new strain) does cause pneumonia... [SEP] COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Prognosis
The severity of COVID-19 varies. COVID-19 : everything you need to know about the Corona Virus and the race for the vaccine (First ed.). "Advice on COVID-19 (coronavirus)". A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.The U.S. experienced 882,000 "excess deaths" (i.e., deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years) between February 2020 and January 2022, which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID-19 during that period (835,000 deaths). Background
COVID-19 pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China in mid-December 2019, when a group of people developed a pneumonia without clear causes, and existing treatments were found to be ineffective. The government abandoned its zero-COVID policy on 7 December 2022.After discovery of a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, a public notice on the outbreak was distributed on 31 December 2019. Subsequent research by COVID Symptom Study suggested this increased the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
   So basically we never have to wear sunblock again because UV rays kill the virus. Of course those same rays can cause skin cancer, but at least no Corona right? SMH Don't forget to drink some bleach tonight.  gets my vote [SEP] Sunscreen, also known as sunblock or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer. The routine use of sunscreens may also reduce the risk of melanoma. Health effects
Benefits
Sunscreen use can help prevent melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two types of skin cancer. A study on 32 subjects showed that daily use of sunscreen (SPF 30) reversed photoaging of the skin within 12 weeks and the amelioration continued until the end of the investigation period of one year. Sunscreen is inherently anti-ageing as the sun is the number one cause of premature ageing, it therefore may slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles, dark spots and sagging skin. Sunblock
Sunblock typically refers to opaque sunscreen that is effective at blocking both UVA and UVB rays and uses a heavy carrier oil to resist being washed off. Since sunscreen's active ingredients work preventatively by creating a shielding film on the skin that absorbs, scatters, and reflects light before it can reach the skin, UV filters have been deemed an ideal “first line of defense” against sun damage when exposure can't be avoided. Sunscreen safety debate
Medical organizations recommend that patients protect themselves from UV radiation by using sunscreen. 
Diet, exercise, and other interventions, you can radically reduce your risk of COVID-19. The focus of my COVID-19 prevention method is on strengthening immune function through stress and anxiety reduction. Chronic stress cause inflammation which has a profound impact on diseases [SEP] Prevention involves adequate physical exercise, decreasing obesity, treating high blood pressure, eating a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Effective lifestyle changes include:

Weight control
Smoking cessation
Avoiding the consumption of trans fats (in partially hydrogenated oils)
Decreasing psychosocial stress
ExerciseAerobic exercise, like walking, jogging, or swimming, can reduce the risk of mortality from coronary artery disease. In cases where remission is possible, relapse can be prevented and symptoms controlled with medication, lifestyle and dietary changes, changes to eating habits (eating smaller amounts more often), reduction of stress, moderate activity, and exercise. Lifestyle changes
Certain lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms, including dietary adjustments, elemental diet, proper hydration, and smoking cessation. Studies have shown that academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular physical exercise.There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of exercise performed from approximately 700–2000 kcal of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly men. Although the relationship of stress and Alzheimer's is unclear, strategies to reduce stress and relax the mind may be helpful strategies in preventing the progression or Alzheimer's disease. Omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and anti-oxidants have been suggested by some studies that might help preventing crisis but the evidence is still inconclusive.Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective. Lifestyle modification
Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. 
 It's just so ignorant and stupid to insist the covid-19 vaccine will cause people to be  magnetic.  It's just so ridiculous It's pitiful. [SEP] An 1894 edition of the local paper, the Davenport Leader, wrote:

A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. Anti-vaccination
Like his son, Palmer was against vaccines:

It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox or any other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him:
A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method... he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims... His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack.Before adopting the term "chiropractic" in about 1896, his advertising used the term "magnetic". Palmer wrote, "It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox or any other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison." Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: "A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands.

There’s no evidence that the new #vaccine against COVID-19 cause infertility, yet that’s a worry that’s been cited by some has a reason they’re reluctant to be first in line to get the shots. #covid #infertility https://t.co/NlB1y0WWWw [SEP] Safety concerns
While some anti-vaccinationists openly deny the improvements vaccination has made to public health or believe in conspiracy theories, it is much more common to cite concerns about safety. As with any medical treatment, there is a potential for vaccines to cause serious complications, such as severe allergic reactions, but unlike most other medical interventions, vaccines are given to healthy people and so a higher standard of safety is demanded. While serious complications from vaccinations are possible, they are extremely rare and much less common than similar risks from the diseases they prevent. The resulting controversy has caused many parents to delay or avoid immunizing their children. Based on studies in animal models, theoretical concerns have been raised about a possible link between schizophrenia and maternal immune response activated by virus antigens; a 2009 review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of trivalent influenza vaccine during the first trimester of pregnancy, but that the vaccine was still recommended outside the first trimester and in special circumstances such as pandemics or in women with certain other conditions. There have been a number of reasons expressed why people might not wish to take COVID-19 vaccines, such as concerns over safety, self-perception of being "low risk", or questioning the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in particular. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. 
     a person who had high blood pressure or diabetes out it is still the Covid19 that killed them. They would be contributing caused not the primary one.[NEWLINE]And yes, if a person had  Covid but  had a diabetic coma and died you would likely say that the diabetic coma was the primary [SEP] Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.Blood pressure is classified by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Nevertheless, primary or essential hypertension accounts for most cases. Society and culture
Awareness
The World Health Organization has identified hypertension, or high blood pressure, as the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. These complications are also a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.The primary complications of diabetes due to damage in small blood vessels include damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. 
   No.  The Mrna vaccines don't use the live virus that causes covid-19.  The astrazeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus as a delivery system.  This  "vector" virus does not cause covid - 19. [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. When introduced into human tissue, the vaccine contains either self-replicating RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), which both cause cells to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. Medical uses
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Pharmacology
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine containing a modified, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1, containing the full‐length codon‐optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence. Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca COVID‐19 Vaccine, and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca are manufactured by AstraZeneca.

The Church of Satan claims they do not solicit memberships nor proselytize. The Church of Satan (PDF) (5th ed.). The Church of Satan: A History of the World's Most Notorious Religion. Satan Speaks!. Eventually in 2012, a Pakistani Taliban commander in North Waziristan in Pakistan banned polio vaccinations, and in March 2013, the Afghan government was forced to suspend its vaccination efforts in Nuristan Province because the Taliban was extremely influential in the province. However, in May 2013, the Taliban's leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations, saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are "unbiased" and "harmonized with the regional conditions, Islamic values and local cultural traditions." 
There is something I don't get - why does an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer's cause breathing problems?  Those with COVID-19 have such problems presumably because the virus is attacking the lungs. But the mRNA vaccines don't contain any viruses. [SEP] A 2004 review of the safety of influenza vaccines in children stated that the live vaccine had been shown to be safe but that it might trigger wheezing in some children with asthma; less data for the trivalent inactivated vaccine was available, but no serious symptoms had been seen in clinical trials. The WHO states that no severe side effects have been associated with these vaccines, although they can produce mild inflammation at the site of injection. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. Respiratory
Cough is another typical symptom of COVID-19, which could be either dry or a productive cough.Some symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are more common in patients who need hospital care. Effect of vaccination
The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines provide effective protection against COVID-19, including against severe disease, hospitalisation, and death, and "a growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission" as chains of transmission are interrupted by vaccines. The potential mechanisms how fluvoxamine and fluoxetin are contributing to prevent the development of severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 by protecting the type 2 lung alveolar cells have been summarized in a review in March 2022. Influenza vaccine: A clinical cohort study in Brazil found that COVID-19 patients who received a recent influenza vaccine needed less intensive care support, less invasive respiratory support, and were less likely to die.

[SEP] Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. A person with measles encephalitis may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.The measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system which can cause deaths from other diseases. A May 2022 report from The New York Times noted that "A wave of parents has been radicalized by Covid-era misinformation to reject ordinary childhood immunizations — with potentially lethal consequences." The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.

It doesn't suddenly come in a rush! 🤦‍♀️ I do know people who've had Covid - they had a worse reaction to the AZ vaccine but only 24-48 hours. Covid symptoms were awful and more than a month. [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. A study is investigating the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 provided by the mRNA vaccines. Effectiveness
Duration of immunity
As of 2021, available evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least six months. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. References

 Precisely. It’s what I’ve said. Me being a young adult COVID does not affect me that much. A common flu is more severe for me, this vaccine we don’t know the long term health risks. The first vaccine caused blood clots, Who know what else these new one can cause [SEP] On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects." COVID-19 reinfections are thought to likely be less severe than primary infections, especially if one was previously infected by the same variant. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Vaccines
A COVID-19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID-19.As of March 2023, more than 5.5 billion people had received one or more doses (11.8 billion in total) in over 197 countries. According to a June 2022 study, COVID-19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 million to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.On 8 November 2022, the first recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax's booster Nuvaxovid) was authorized for use in adults in the United Kingdom. On 10 November, Germany advised against the Moderna vaccine for people under 30, due to a possible association with myocarditis. 
  ...so a vaccine trialed in a study from the early 2000s can cause a liver inflammatory response in ferrets. But so can Covid-19, along with inflammation of most major organ systems. [SEP] However, vaccines have been produced against several animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious bronchitis virus in birds, canine coronavirus, and feline coronavirus. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis. Nasal vaccines have been approved for influenza, but not for COVID-19. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination.

#COVID19 IS NOT A COLD Soooo If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, understand that this can happen: “#coronavirus could be acting like herpes, which causes cold sores & in rare cases, brain swelling AKA #encephalitis. That swelling triggers the immune system.“ https://t.co/dw3WQZCbmr [SEP] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognise the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses.It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms

 An organization that doesn't use statistics to guide policy is inept. 6 vaccine injuries out of 7 million doses administered. One in a million odds. Versus what are the odds of injury from covid? Less than one in a million? An over abundance of caution can cause harm. [SEP] Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.Most vaccine development to date has relied on "push" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis. For 4,041,396 Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine dose administrations in December 2020 and January 2021, only ten cases of anaphylaxis were reported. In July 2021, The BMJ reported that countries have thrown out over 250,000 vaccine doses as supply exceeded demand and strict laws prevented the sharing of vaccines. Economics

There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect.   https://t.co/aTtdgb6xWf [SEP] Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of chemoreceptors. Gustatory system (taste)
The gustatory system or the sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the multimodal integration of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations. The inability to taste is called ageusia. Olfactory system (smell)
Like the sense of taste, the sense of smell, or the olfactory system, is also responsive to chemical stimuli. The inability to smell is called anosmia. Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional spice and seasoning levels for food to be tasted.

In a letter to the European Medicines Agency, Yeadon and the German physician Wolfgang Wodarg called for all vaccine trials to be stopped, falsely suggesting that mRNA vaccines could target the syncytin-1 protein needed for placenta formation. A Telegram account under his name has promoted the unfounded claim that the vaccines cause recipients to become magnetic.Yeadon has been interviewed by The Exposé, a website known for publishing COVID-19 misinformation. In an interview with American political strategist Steve Bannon, Yeadon falsely asserted that children were "50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself", citing a high number of events following COVID-19 vaccination reported on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database.

Some people I know who survived covid infection seem to be prediabetic now. This seems to be a side effect of the infection, perhaps caused by inflammatory damage to the pancreas. Treatment with corticosteroids may cause more damage through elevated blood glucose. [SEP] Prediabetes is a component of the metabolic syndrome and is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that fall below the threshold to diagnose diabetes mellitus. It usually does not cause symptoms but people with prediabetes often have obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Prediabetes can be a reversible condition with lifestyle changes. Signs and symptoms
Prediabetes typically has no distinct signs or symptoms except the sole sign of high blood sugar. Ultimately prediabetes occurs when control of insulin and blood glucose in the body becomes abnormal, also known as insulin resistance. In individuals with prediabetes, a failure of pancreatic hormone release, failure of targeted tissues to respond to the insulin present or both leads to blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels. Hyperinsulinemia precedes prediabetes and diabetes that are characterized by hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a type of condition in which infections are easier to get, and hyperglycemia contributes to the mechanism causing oral complications. 
Covid conundrum: vaccine known to cause headaches, sore arm, fatigue and nausea which are also symptom requiring testing. Must all vaccinated be tested? [SEP] The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Vaccines
A COVID-19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CVS is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting, and often occur alongside symptoms similar to those of migraine headaches (photophobia, abdominal pain, etc.). 
   Several. Heart attack or brain stroke most common cause. That apart, lot of vaccinated people also contracting Covid in some weeks. Several getting serious and some fatalities too. [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam has resulted in 11,619,322 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 43,206 deaths, along with 11,555,383 recoveries. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) were known as major pathogens which caused respiratory illnesses, a new strain of coronavirus known as SARS-CoV caused an outbreak in 29 countries from 2002 to 2004. Antibody levels fall quickly after recovery, and side effects similar to those of blood transfusion (including fluid overload, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction and allergic transfusion reaction) may occur.In October 2020, scientists at the Medical Genetics Institute, the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control (HCDC) and Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University planned to sequence the genome of COVID-19 to learn how it affects different people and possibly identify genes sensitive to the virus. On 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded the first death of a person vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine: a female, 35-year-old medical worker in An Giang province.In July 2021, the Ministry of Health authorized mixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with patient consent if supplies are limited. 25 April – COVID-19 in the UK: The number of people who died in hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK exceeds 20,000. assorted factors such as ethnicity, age, or genetic predisposition.If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated cases.Important considerations in an effective vaccination program:
careful modeling to anticipate the effect that an immunization campaign will have on the epidemiology of the disease in the medium to long term
ongoing surveillance for the relevant disease following introduction of a new vaccine
maintenance of high immunization rates, even when a disease has become rareIn 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. Cases of veterinary vaccines used in humans have been documented, whether intentional or accidental, with some cases of resultant illness, most notably with brucellosis. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Makes perfect sense considering that asthma is a chronic lung inflammation, and COVID19 causes severe acute lung inflammation (hence the name SARS-Cov2, of which SARS stands for Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome).. can't get a lung infection if you already have it chronically. [SEP] Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality. Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children. This type of history has been labelled the "infectious asthma" (IA) syndrome, or as "asthma associated with infection" (AAWI) to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high. When comorbid with COPD there is more systemic inflammation. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.

Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Ismail urged for an immediate action against the perpetrators involved in this pollution that endangered public lives while expressing his appreciation for the medical teams which had been working tirelessly to treat the victims in hospital. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail visited victims of the pollution at the hospital in Johor Bahru on 14 March, and said that the situation was "under control" where residents are not necessary to be evacuated from the area and also that there is a need to review the country's Environmental Quality Act 1974 in light of the serious pollution. Malaysia's Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister Xavier Jayakumar Arulanandam urged every state governments to take serious measures to overcome river pollution as climate change could cause the country to experience long periods of drought in the future. Criticism of government response and lawsuits
Johor's Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Idris took the matter to Twitter to express his opinion that the government should have instead declared a state of emergency on the day it first occurred and relocated residents to a temporary place until there was a guarantee that the area was safe.

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS. Children with HIV may benefit from screening for tuberculosis. Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections; however, evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.People with HIV/AIDS are up to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who are not tested positive with the virus.Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit. Some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV. This result is consistent with the conclusion presented by Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and his team in a viewpoint published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that U=U is an effective HIV prevention method when an undetectable viral load is maintained.Genital herpes (HSV-2) reactivation in those infected with the virus have an associated increase in CCR-5 enriched CD4+ T cells as well as inflammatory dendritic cells in the submucosa of the genital skin.

So you are still better off having the jab than Covid itself & at least we know what signs to look for [SEP] Jabber may refer to:

The original name of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), the open technology for instant messaging and presence. History and development
Jeremie Miller began working on the Jabber technology in 1998 and released the first version of the jabberd server on January 4, 1999. Vaccines introduce a weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganism in order to evoke a primary immune response. This is so that in the case that an exposure to the real pathogen occurs, the body can rely on the secondary immune response to quickly defend against it. This affinity depends on the type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together. To limit extensive tissue damage during an infection, CTL activation is tightly controlled and in general requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by "helper" T-cells (see below). Upon activation, B cells produce antibodies, each of which recognize a unique antigen, and neutralizing specific pathogens.Antigen and antibody binding would cause five different protective mechanisms:

Agglutination: Reduces number of infectious units to be dealt with
Activation of complement: Cause inflammation and cell lysis
Opsonization: Coating antigen with antibody enhances phagocytosis
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity: Antibodies attached to target cell cause destruction by macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells
Neutralization: Blocks adhesion of bacteria and viruses to mucosaLike the T cell, B cells express a unique B cell receptor (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. This theory, which builds on the existing clonal selection hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by Niels Jerne and Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the HIV pathogenesis and the search for an HIV vaccine. 
   Vaxed could have lowered immune systems for days after the vaccination that could cause more problems. There are prophylatics available. Does Haiti use Ivermectin as standard and few covid cases and Dominican republic I think gave care staff,  doctors something different. Better? [SEP] This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Vaccination
Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.Many vaccines are based on acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. Although he explained the immunity in terms of "excess moisture" being expelled from the blood—therefore preventing a second occurrence of the disease—this theory explained many observations about smallpox known during this time.These and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. 
       COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. It’s not the Democrats providing the Covid-19 deaths it’s the CDC, Johns Hopkins and other healthcare professionals. [SEP] These emails contain information about how the United States and Fauci initially responded to COVID-19.On June 22, 2021, Fauci said that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the "greatest threat" to eliminating COVID-19 in the United States.In December 2021, Fauci, along with virologist Jeffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens endorsed the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, advocating in favor of "an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full "universe" of existing and emerging coronaviruses. He contrasted COVID-19's mortality rate with that of Ebola, stating: "This is a flu. The quote was made public on September 9, a few days in advance of the scheduled release of Woodward's book, Rage.Trump has repeatedly compared COVID-19 to influenza, despite Fauci estimating COVID-19 to have a mortality rate around ten times higher. On March 9, Trump compared the 546 known U.S. cases of COVID-19 at the time and the 22 known deaths at the time to the tens of thousands of U.S. deaths from flu each year. On March 27, he stated: "You can call it a flu. October
On October 6, Trump claimed that COVID-19 is "in most populations far less lethal" than the flu. COVID-19 emerged during Trump's presidency, at the end of 2019. COVID-19's origins
On April 30, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the U.S. intelligence community "concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified." 
  Corona viruses is a group of viruses , well known for many many years  ...which cause the common cold but the COVID 19 is a new one and more dangerous than a common cold (in my opinion produced in a lab) [SEP] In the newspaper, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is known as the "CCP virus", and a commentary in the newspaper posed the question, "is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at that [Wuhan P4 virology] lab?" COVID-19 is a new zoonotic disease, so no population has yet had the time to develop population immunity.Beginning on 11 February 2020, reports quickly spread via Facebook, implied that a Cameroonian student in China had been completely cured of the virus due to his African genetics.

Name of the disease
Social media posts and Internet memes claimed that COVID-19 derives from "Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease 19", or similar, as supposedly the "19th virus to come out of China". In fact, the WHO named the disease as follows: CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).Another false social media rumor claimed COVID-19 was an acronym derived from a series of ancient symbols interpreted as "see a sheep surrender."

Hypothesis. If #LongCovid is caused by some ongoing reaction from the immune system (auto-inflammation, auto-immunity). Maybe Rituximab could help to ease down again the over-reacting immune system (B-cells)? [SEP] Immunotherapy may produce long-term benefits. Inflammation may be involved. A review of long COVID research found half of those affected met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.Another review found that risk factors for developing CFS after mononucleosis, dengue fever, or Q-fever included longer bed-rest during the illness, poorer pre-illness physical fitness, attributing symptoms to physical illness, belief that a long recovery time is needed, as well as pre-infection distress and fatigue. Rintatolimod
Rintatolimod is a double-stranded RNA drug developed to modulate an antiviral immune reaction through activation of toll-like receptor 3. : 10  The emergence of long COVID has sparked increased interest in ME/CFS, as the two conditions may share pathology, and a treatment for one may treat the other. Treatments
Various drugs have been or are being investigated for treating ME/CFS.The drug rintatolimod is currently in an experimental trial in the US to treat both ME/CFS and Long COVID. Rituximab, a drug that depletes B cells, was studied and found to be ineffective. This has been shown for lymphoma patients who received the antibody Rituxan. 
    SARSCoV2 is the virus. Covid 19 is the disease it causes. Just like HIV is a virus and AIDS is the disease it causes. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Do you know anything Janet?    https://t.co/KZsHsqFUmU [SEP] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans.SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as "the COVID-19 virus" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Phylogenetics and taxonomy
SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).

There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
    Again anecdotally, I’ve spent the last few months giving falls leaflets and “Keeping Fit and Active” leaflets to my friends’ parents. I think the physical deconditioning from Covid has caused enormous problems in terms of falls risk, loss of muscle bulk and cognitive decline [SEP] It is also known as the Canadian Falls. About 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of the crest caused the falls to retreat approximately 6.8 miles (10.9 km) southward. Future of the falls
The current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters (1 ft) per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m (3 ft) per year. Jones tried going over the falls again in 2017, using a large inflatable ball, but died in the process. Although The New York Times had long before described attempting to tour the falls as "bent on suicide" and despite a number of fatal crashes, the "as many as 100 eight-minute rides each day" are hard to regulate; two countries and various government agencies would have to coordinate.

I was much more sad that my work won't allow me to bring banana bread for everyone because of covid than I was to find out the j&j vaccine could cause blood clots [SEP] It is the largest immunisation programme implemented in the history of the country, and it is being administered by the Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV) since early 2021. Committees in charge
The Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply
The Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply, also known as the Special Committee on COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (Malay: Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19; abbreviation: JKJAV), is a government body that was established to ensure the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine supply for the country can be carried out smoothly and in order. Despite this, there was no indication from the government that private hospitals and clinics will be allowed to purchase vaccines on their own as the vaccine being distributed are from the government's stock.On 3 August, A private hospital doctor, Dr Musa Nordin, has launched a scathing attack on Malaysia's COVID-19 vaccination programme, accusing the Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV) not only of flip-flopping, but also of corruption. 20 February – COVID-19 in the UK: As the number of people receiving their first vaccine dose exceeds 17 million, Boris Johnson announces he wants the programme to "go further and faster" by offering every adult in the UK their first jab by 31 July. 15 March – COVID-19 in the UK: The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says there is no evidence linking the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine to blood clots after several European countries pause their use of the vaccine as a precautionary measure. 6 April – COVID-19 in the UK: A trial of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine on children is halted while the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. 7 April
COVID-19 in the UK:
A review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) finds that of the 20 million people who received the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK up to 31 March 79 people suffered rare blood clots – 19 of whom have died. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises that under-30s should be offered an alternative jab to the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots. 
 Here‘s why you should get the vaccine. Covid causes inflammation to the central nervous system and can cause damage including strokes and psychosis. Since you play a game that also causes brain injuries, it would be best for you to not have your brain fight both. [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection.

History
The use of masks in rituals or ceremonies is a very ancient human practice across the world, although masks can also be worn for protection, in hunting, in sports, in feasts, or in wars – or simply used as ornamentation. Masks are a familiar and vivid element in many folk and traditional pageants, ceremonies, rituals, and festivals, and are often of an ancient origin. Masks are an important part of many theatre forms throughout world cultures, and their usage in theatre has often developed from, or continues to be part of old, highly sophisticated, stylized theatrical traditions. There has been a proliferation of such masks recently but there is a long history of protective armour and even medical masks to ward off plague.

In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Analysis of VigiBase reported embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, found a temporally related incidence of 0.21 cases per 1 million vaccinated-days.Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are known side effects of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Safety review
In March 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that there is no indication that vaccination has been the cause of the observed clotting issues, which were not listed as side effects of the vaccine. The DHPC indicated that a causal relationship between the vaccine and blood clots (thrombosis) in combination with low blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) was plausible and identified it as a very rare side effect of the vaccine.

Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty, kidney stone extractions, sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects.The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages, and then to human physicians. Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at least the beginning of the common era.There is no good evidence that Ayurveda is effective to treat or cure cancer.

Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern Chinese and European systems of medicine. There are various legendary accounts of the origin of Ayurveda, such as that it was received by Dhanvantari (or Divodasa) from Brahma. Tradition also holds that the writings of Ayurveda were influenced by a lost text by the sage Agnivesha.Ayurveda is one of the few systems of medicine developed in ancient times that is still widely practiced in modern times.

  The error in dealing with the Covid19 was preventing treatments without the so called vaccine. HCQ and Ivermectin were/are good treatments. That cause a large number of unnecessary deaths. And then the nursing home insanity. Bureaucrap and ComDem_Covid_Dictators. [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Bioethics
Since the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Some deaths were because people with other conditions could not access medical services.A December 2022 WHO study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during 2020 and 2021, again concluding ≈14.8 million excess early deaths occurred, reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them, addressing criticisms. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. However, the difficulty of reaching all children, cultural misunderstandings, and disinformation have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.Vaccines also help prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. Challenges
There have been several unique challenges with COVID‑19 vaccine development. 
Giving yourself a tension headache by worrying that you might get a headache which could indicate that you’ve developed blood clots after your covid jab, even though you know you didn’t have the one that can cause blood clots and just scared yourself reading the side-effects. https://t.co/0kokui7ui6 [SEP] Treatment
Treatment for a current tension headache is to drink water and confirm that there is no dehydration. Headache, also known as cephalalgia, is the symptom of pain in the face, head, or neck. The mechanism behind these headaches is unclear, possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate, causing pain. The excessive use of painkillers can paradoxically cause worsening painkiller headaches.More serious causes of secondary headaches include the following:
meningitis: inflammation of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus, or stiff neck
bleeding inside the brain (intracranial hemorrhage)
subarachnoid hemorrhage (acute, severe headache, stiff neck without fever)
ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, intraparenchymal hemorrhage (headache only)
brain tumor: dull headache, worse with exertion and change in position, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Most of these primary headaches are tension headaches.

No lasting effect. The unvaccinated are the new 21 st century Lepers. Cause Variants [SEP] An autoimmune disease is a condition arising from an abnormal immune response to a functioning body part. Some common diseases that are generally considered autoimmune include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, graves' disease, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, alopecia areata, addison's disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoimmune diseases cause inflammation in various ways, but the particular cause of inflammation does not greatly affect cancer risk. Some common diseases that are generally considered autoimmune include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, Graves' disease, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are listed here. Analysis of large cohort data shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) is linked to a substantially increased risk of developing a diverse new-onset autoimmune diseases. The majority of the autoimmune diseases are chronic and there is no definitive cure, but symptoms can be alleviated and controlled with treatment. Autoimmune diseases qualifiers

The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause a disorder characterized by dangerous blood clots and low platelet counts. In Europe, at least 222 suspected cases have been reported among people who have received the vaccine. More than 30 have died. [SEP] Side-effects
On 6 April 2021, EMA head of vaccines Marco Cavaleri announced that it could be declared that there was a link between the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 (Vaxzevria) vaccine and rare blood clots associated with low platelet counts. In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Analysis of VigiBase reported embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, found a temporally related incidence of 0.21 cases per 1 million vaccinated-days.Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are known side effects of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Although no causal link with vaccination has been shown, several other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia also halted the vaccine rollout over the following days while waiting for the EMA to finish a safety review triggered by the cases.In April 2021, the EMA concluded its safety review and concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects while reaffirming the overall benefits of the vaccine. Then, on 15 April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommended to the government to permanently suspended vaccination with AstraZeneca due to the "rare but severe incidents with low platelet counts, blood clots, and haemorrhages," since in the case of Norway, "the risk of dying after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine would be higher than the risk of dying from the disease, particularly for younger people." AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found. The company reported that as of 8 March 2021, across the EU and UK, there had been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, which is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of that size.In March 2021, the German Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI) reported that out of 1.6 million vaccinations, seven cases of cerebral vein thrombosis in conjunction with a deficiency of blood platelets had occurred. The DHPC indicated that a causal relationship between the vaccine and blood clots (thrombosis) in combination with low blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) was plausible and identified it as a very rare side effect of the vaccine. 
 Allopathic medicines are very costly. They eliminate the symptoms of diseases and cause other diseases in the body.  Asharamji Bapu has got many side effects in His body with allopathic medicines in the treatment of covid, so we demand for Ayurvedic medicine. #आयुर्वेद_हमारी_शान [SEP] Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used by 19th-century homeopaths to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern evidence-based medicine . American health advocate and sceptic William T. Jarvis, stated that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular medicine." Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness or to alleviate an illness by eliminating its cause. "Hahnemann used "allopathy" to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence the Greek root allo- "different") from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. As used by homeopaths, the term allopathy has always referred to the principle of treating disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). American health educator and skeptic William T. Jarvis, stated in 2008 that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular medicine".Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Samuel Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.

 LOSE WEIGHT!!!! More than 40% of US citizens are obese! Obesity causes diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, cancer, etc., i.e. exactly those underlying health problems which increase the risk of dying from Covid, also for younger people! LOSE WEIGHT NOW TO REDUCE RISK [SEP] Obesity is common in the United States and is a major health issue associated with numerous diseases, specifically an increased risk of certain types of cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease, as well as significant increases in early mortality and economic costs. In particular, diabetes has become the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimating in 2008 that fifty-seven million adults aged twenty and older were pre-diabetic, 23.6 million diabetic, with 90–95% of the latter being type 2-diabetic.Obesity has also been shown to increase the prevalence of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. ^ Except territories, whose data is from the late 2000s to 2010s

Total costs to the US
Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000–400,000 deaths in the United States per year (including increased morbidity in car accidents) and has increased health care use and expenditures, costing society an estimated $117 billion in direct (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services related to weight) and indirect (absenteeism, loss of future earnings due to premature death) costs. A study suggests, using an epidemiological model, that by reducing the transferred viral load, face masks against COVID19 may be beneficial for variolation whereby "smaller infectious doses tend to yield milder infections, yet ultimately induce similar levels of immunity". A CDC study based on electronic health records shows that "one in five COVID-19 survivors aged 18–64 years and one in four survivors aged ≥65 years experienced at least one incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19" or long COVID. 13 September
A study reports results indicating COVID-19 may significantly increase risk for Alzheimer's disease, similar to prior studies about long-term impacts besides long COVID on cardiovascular outcomes, diabetes, neurologic sequelae, mental health disorders, and general future mortality after COVID-19, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. In a paywalled article, American scientists propose policy-based measures to reduce large risks from life sciences research – such as pandemics through accident or misapplication. These numbers do not include measures like years of potential life lost, far exceed the 5.42 million officially reported deaths, may make COVID-19 2021's leading cause of death, and are similar to the ~18 million estimated by another study (see 10 Mar). 
    COVID can cause horrible and debilitating secondary effects among those who survive. Lung, heart, and brain issues, as well as blood clots and circulation issues, have all been linked to COVID.  They don't go away when the initial infection is resolved. https://t.co/1gLEegZStL [SEP] Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Symptoms and signs
Complications
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.

    Ffs! I don't know how many more times it can be explained to people really.[NEWLINE]Just because you have cancer or a brain tumour or anything else terminal. There are other causes of death that expedite the original cause of illness. Covid is one of those things. [SEP] On "My Baby's Taking Me Home" of Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Suddenly, the God of Love appears and tells Rentarō that the reason for his non-existent love life is because everyone is only supposed to have one soulmate in their life, but due to an error on the God of Love's part, Rentarō is destined to have 100. She gave birth to Hakari when she was thirteen, due to having fallen in love with a terminally ill fellow student. The separation of newline into two functions concealed the fact that the print head could not return from the far right to the beginning of the next line in time to print the next character. This is why a newline in character encoding can be defined as CR and LF combined into one (commonly called CR+LF or CRLF). Example:

Python permits "Universal Newline Support" when opening a file for reading, when importing modules, and when executing a file.Some languages have created special variables, constants, and subroutines to facilitate newlines during program execution. In these cases there's a need to identify where one JSON encoded object ends and the next begins. Length-prefixed JSON is also well-suited for TCP applications, where a single "message" may be divided into arbitrary chunks, because the prefixed length tells the parser exactly how many bytes to expect before attempting to parse a JSON string. 
Brazil regulator rejects Sputnik V vaccine citing serious quality, safety concerns. Cells where adenovirus is produced “allow its replication,” which “can lead to infections in humans and can cause injury and death” #COVID19 #coronavirus  #CoronaVaccine  https://t.co/OHd3NbLcEm [SEP] "In March 2021, it was revealed the US attempted to convince Brazil not to purchase the Sputnik V COVID‑19 vaccine, fearing "Russian influence" in Latin America. Sputnik V (Russian: Спутник V, the brand name from RDIF) or Gam-COVID-Vac (Russian: Гам-КОВИД-Вак, the name under which it is legally registered and produced) is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia. Although a report from Argentina published in the New England Journal of Medicine described fatal vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in a young woman after receipt of Sputnik-V.

Pharmacology
Gam-COVID-Vac is a viral vector vaccine based on two recombinant replication-defective human adenoviruses: Ad26 (serotype 26) and Ad5 (serotype 5) replicated in HEK 293 cells. As of June 2021, Sputnik V is under rolling review process by EMA, but the marketing authorisation application was not submitted yet.Emergency use has also been authorized in Algeria, Bolivia, Serbia, the Palestinian territories, and Mexico.On 25 January 2021, Iran approved the vaccine, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif saying the country hopes to begin purchases and start joint production of the shot "in the near future", after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned the government from importing vaccines from the United States and United Kingdom.The Czech Republic is also considering buying Sputnik V, and Prime Minister Andrej Babis dismissed the minister of health, Jan Blatný, who was a loud opponent to the use of Sputnik V.On 4 March 2021, EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has started a rolling review of Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac), a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Russia's Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology. German medical experts have recommended its approval also, and consider the Sputnik Vaccine "clever" and "highly safe".On 19 March 2021, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Sputnik V, the fourth COVID-19 vaccine to be given authorization. Brazil
On 26 April 2021, the Brazilian health regulator Anvisa rejected the use of Sputnik V, alleging a lack of consistent and reliable data and the presence of replicating adenovirus in the vaccine. Medicinal chemist Derek Lowe commented that the presence of replicating adenoviruses is unlikely to cause any major problems, but it is a "completely unnecessary risk", that it certainly will harm some people, and that providing a product different from the one described in studies undermines the credibility of all manufacturing and quality control processes, adding that some posts on the official Sputnik V Twitter account constitute "aggressive political marketing" and some make invalid claims regarding the performance of competing vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. He also said that real-world data from Argentina and Mexico showed no adverse effects greater than those seen in people vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or CoronaVac.On June 4, Anvisa approved exceptional imports of Sputnik V, restricting it mainly to healthy adults and limiting it to only 1% of the population of 6 importing states, in order to manage risks through control and supervision of side effects. 
Such a dangerous decision. There were 6 instances out of 7 million vaccinations. Blood clots are a known complication of COVID-19, so it is not surprising that the immune response may cause them. Further, FDA approved birth control has an incidence of 1 in 1,000, yet still used. https://t.co/gOEZlCOQMu [SEP] While minor side effects, such as soreness or low grade fever, are relatively common, serious side effects are very rare and occur in about 1 out of every 100,000 vaccinations and typically involve allergic reactions that can cause hives or difficulty breathing.However, vaccines are the safest they ever have been in history and each vaccine undergoes rigorous clinical trials to ensure their safety and efficacy before approval by authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Prior to human testing, vaccines are tested on cell cultures and the results modelled to assess how they will interact with the immune system. Dengvaxia, the only approved vaccine for Dengue fever, was found to increase the risk of hospitalization for Dengue fever by 1.58 times in children of 9 years or younger, resulting in the suspension of a mass vaccination program in the Philippines in 2017.Pandemrix – a vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 given to around 31 million people – was found to have a higher level of adverse events than alternative vaccines resulting in legal action. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. Compulsory vaccinations greatly reduce infection rates for the diseases they protect against.Common objections included the argument that governments should not infringe on individuals' freedom to make medical decisions for themselves or their children, or claims that proposed vaccinations were dangerous. Of the theoretical group of 4,261,494 babies, beginning in 2009, who had followed a standard childhood immunization schedule under the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines "will prevent ∼42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease, with net savings of $13.5 billion in direct costs and $68.8 billion in total societal costs, respectively." Although these implementations would make Italy a European frontrunner in vaccination, some experts questioned the need for several of the vaccines, and some physicians worried about the potential punishment they may face if they do not comply with the proposed regulations.There were 5,000 cases of measles in 2017, up from 870 in 2016. During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines.In 1922, the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case Zucht v. King. Parents say that vaccine mandates to attend public schools prevent one's right to choose, especially if the vaccinations could be harmful. 
           In other words (translation into English), what u and those looking at cholinergic system disruption ( ) are saying is that neurological distress  leads to respiratory distress in covid, that neuro-mediated hypoximia causes covid pneumonia? [SEP] I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire [it is better to interpret than to translate] ...Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents. English translation: Berman, Antoine (2009). Translated by Kasparek, Christopher. This might lead to mistranslations. Therefore, a disruption to the cholinergic system has been proposed as a consequence of AD rather than a direct cause. Many neurological systems are cholinergic. Recent findings imply that aging-related cognitive deficits are due to impairments of cholinergic function rather than cholinergic cell loss. Cholinergic system research may provide the key to treating and reversing this devastating disease. 
   You are mistaken.  COVID-19 antibodies are ONLY made when a person gets the virus.  Whether a person gets sick depends on how healthy their immune system is or other factors.  Vaccines cause antibodies to be made by a person, without getting sick, just like in asym infections. [SEP] The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably, though the term 'antibody' is sometimes reserved for the secreted, soluble form, i.e. Activated B cells differentiate into either antibody-producing cells called plasma cells that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.At the prenatal and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Natural antibodies
Humans and higher primates also produce "natural antibodies" that are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred a very long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In 2020, the administration of monoclonal antibodies was authorized by several countries for treating moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Recombinant antibody engineering involves antibody production by the use of viruses or yeast, rather than mice. 
 We need to realize that COVID is a disorder of the Immune system. A disordered immune response leads to acute critical COVID and chronic inflammation causes PASC, #Leronlimab is an immunomodulator that has shown to help both groups of patients! [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑7, IL‑6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM‑CSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP‑10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1‑alpha (MIP‑1‑alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF‑α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.Interferon alpha plays a complex, Janus-faced role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19.Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease.A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU.Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to intensive care units (ICU).Between 5% and 50% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID, a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease. 
      I wish more attention would be paid to the importance of the Pentose-Phosphate-Pathway in optimal immune function & how COVID demands G6PD/NADPH, etc - & inability of the body to supply can cause ALL severe &/or long reactions [SEP] Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. Other causes in emergency room settings include sepsis, Kawasaki syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug overdose, serotonin syndrome, and thyroid storm. Function
Immune function
Fever is thought to contribute to host defense, as the reproduction of pathogens with strict temperature requirements can be hindered, and the rates of some important immunological reactions are increased by temperature. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 synthase. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs. In theory, these critically ill patients and those faced with additional physiologic stress may benefit from fever reduction, but the evidence on both sides of the argument appears to be mostly equivocal. Epidemiology
Fever is one of the most common medical signs. "Chapter 27: Regulation of Body Temperature (Clinical Focus: Pathogenesis of Fever)". 
  Yes, COVID-19 can cause various problems. The VACCINE cannot. [SEP] Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. According to the EMA "the benefits of Comirnaty in preventing COVID‑19 continue to outweigh any risks, and there are no recommended changes regarding the use of this vaccine." Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. 
  Covid 19 causes blood clots that trigger heart attacks and strokes, explains why he was in perfect condition a few weeks ago, but the disease was silently ravaging his body [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. Microclots have been found to be a characteristic feature in severe cases of COVID-19, and in long COVID.Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a large blood vessel or heart chamber. Some of the conditions which increase the risk of blood clots developing include atrial fibrillation (a form of cardiac arrhythmia), heart valve replacement, a recent heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction), extended periods of inactivity (see deep venous thrombosis), and genetic or disease-related deficiencies in the blood's clotting abilities. Extremes of temperature are also associated.A number of acute and chronic infections including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, influenza, Helicobacter pylori, and Porphyromonas gingivalis among others have been linked to atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In addition to myocardial infarction, other causes include angina, insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the heart muscles without evidence of cell death, gastroesophageal reflux disease; pulmonary embolism, tumors of the lungs, pneumonia, rib fracture, costochondritis, heart failure and other musculoskeletal injuries. Stroke is also a risk, either as a result of clots transmitted from the heart during PCI, as a result of bleeding following anticoagulation, or as a result of disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively as a result of the infarction. Society and culture
Depictions of heart attacks in popular media often include collapsing or loss of consciousness which are not common symptoms; these depictions contribute to widespread misunderstanding about the symptoms of myocardial infarctions, which in turn contributes to people not getting care when they should.

Mask (disambiguation)
Face (disambiguation) Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended because they expel the wearer's breath outwards, and an infected wearer would transmit the virus through the valve. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. In June 2020, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said asymptomatic individuals wearing face masks were not to be recommended due to the low prevalence of COVID-19 in the country but noted that it should be reconsidered if cases rise. Properly worn masks are effective in both limiting the spread of the virus by an infected individual and protecting an uninfected individual from infection.The National Health Commission of China cited the following reasons for the wearing of masks by the public, including healthy individuals:

Asymptomatic transmission. Touching
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene." (September 2020), which links the seasonality of respiratory viral diseases to decreased air humidity due to indoor heating, argues that mask-wearing helps limit respiratory virus transmission in winter because masks keep the nose warm and moist.Social media claims that masks could reduce the oxygen levels in older people were refuted by a small study of SpO2 levels, the results of which were published by JAMA. 
      It can be vasovagal syncope (which is basically a faint) - this is relatively common with flu for example which can cause people to feel dizzy/faint, but also with stress. It could be completely unrelated - e.g. a heart arrhythmia leading to collapse. [SEP] Vasovagal syncope is typically triggered by seeing blood, pain, emotional stress, or prolonged standing. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting. Reflex syncope can occur in otherwise healthy individuals, and has many possible causes, often trivial ones such as prolonged standing with the legs locked.The main danger of vasovagal syncope (or dizzy spells from vertigo) is the risk of injury by falling while unconscious. This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions.Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the autonomic nervous system due to systemic diseases (e.g., amyloidosis or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).Hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. While these may appear as "fainting", they do not fit the strict definition of syncope being a sudden reversible loss of consciousness due to decreased blood flow to the brain. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. 
 Masks are a total hoax!! They do not stop the spread of corona virus,in fact bacteria levels are high from wearing the mask a couple of hours&we breathe in all that bacteria in to our lungs which can/does cause pneumonia&pneumonia kills. Let that sink In. Masks can kill us. [SEP] A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment and often they have been employed for rituals and rites. History
The use of masks in rituals or ceremonies is a very ancient human practice across the world, although masks can also be worn for protection, in hunting, in sports, in feasts, or in wars – or simply used as ornamentation. Masks in performance
Throughout the world, masks are used for their expressive power as a feature of masked performance – both ritually and in various theatre traditions. Masks are an important part of many theatre forms throughout world cultures, and their usage in theatre has often developed from, or continues to be part of old, highly sophisticated, stylized theatrical traditions. Medical

  It isn’t denial... the real issue is the mental health problems that your lockdown measures have and will cause.  Suicides and opioid OD are going to be far higher than any Covid deaths and to much younger and physically healthier individuals. [SEP] found evidence that economic downturns lead to increases in the intensity of prescription pain reliever use as well as increases in clinically significant substance use disorders involving opioids.According to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could hit certain populations, such as those suffering from substance use disorders and especially those with opioid use disorder, particularly hard. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has marked the start of health care policies that, should they be adopted permanently, could not only lessen the effects of the pandemic on overdoses, but also make overall treatment of opioid use disorder more effective by eliminating obstacles to previously proven therapies for these disorders.According to an April 2020 Health Affairs journal article "Once The Coronavirus Pandemic Subsides, The Opioid Epidemic Will Rage," recommended potential solutions include requiring doctors in large physician groups to get the federal waiver that would allow them to prescribe FDA-approved medications to treat addiction. Many state governors have declared a "state of emergency" to combat the opioid epidemic or undertaken other major efforts against it. In October 2017, President Donald Trump concurred with his Commission's report and declared the country's opioid crisis a "public health emergency". The isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by personal financial and other anxieties, has caused intense difficulty for people coping with addiction disorders as well as depression. Georgia
The isolation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic is hurting Georgians with opioid use disorder. The coronavirus pandemic has overshadowed another, longer term crisis in the state – the opioid epidemic. Due to such stigma, individuals may resist labeling and may be driven to respond to mental health diagnoses with denialism. 
  To quote from the article "There is no proof, however, that the vaccine caused these cases" Also "COVID-19 itself can cause myocarditis" [SEP] Recent study from Israel conludes that natural covid-19-infection is not associated with myocarditis. Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs). Other estimates of the incidence of myocarditis in those with COVID-19 range from 2.4 cases of definite/probable myocarditis (based on clinical criteria) per 1,000 people with COVID-19 to 4.1 cases per 1,000 persons in those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.Although myocarditis is relatively rare in those with COVID-19, when it is present it is likely to follow a severe and fulminant course for those previously hospitalized with COVID-19. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination is estimated to be 0.3 to 5 cases per 100,000 persons with the highest risk in young males. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. 
 People are not experts at understanding absolute and relative risk. -The vaccine may cause this as do other meds and infections -The risk is so low that it's hard to find a background rate and prove it's above baseline -It's a hell of a lot lower than thrombotic risk of COVID [SEP] For example, a vaccine efficacy or effectiveness of 80% indicates an 80% decrease in the number of disease cases among a group of vaccinated people compared to a group in which nobody was vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy is calculated on a set population (and therefore is not a constant value when counting in other populations), and may be misappropriated to be how efficacious a vaccine is in all populations. Formula
The outcome data (vaccine efficacy) generally are expressed as a proportionate reduction in disease attack rate (AR) between the unvaccinated (ARU) and vaccinated (ARV), or can be calculated from the relative risk (RR) of disease among the vaccinated group.The basic formula is written as:with

Also, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) for any vaccine can simply be obtained from calculating the difference of risks between the groups  i.e. Because a clinical trial is based on people who are taking the vaccine and those who are not, there is a risk for disease, and optimal treatment is needed for those who become infected. The major disadvantages of vaccine efficacy trials are the complexity and expense of performing them, especially for relatively uncommon infectious outcomes of diseases for which the sample size required is driven up to achieve clinically useful statistical power. The influenza vaccine is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.Since 2004, clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been slowly coming in: 2,058 people were vaccinated in October and November 2005. 
 So much fake news on this Covid is clearly a  virus and , yes,with a compromised immune system Bacteria will thrive. Covid kills by clotting and, particularly in damaging lung efficiency. Hypoxia can cause heart failure. [SEP] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19.Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. 
 Covid causes heart inflammation in like 70% of people (including asymptomatic).  That seems like a high rate of heart inflammation. [SEP] Cardiovascular
Coagulopathy is stablished to be associated with COVID-19 in those patients in critical state. They are common traits in severe COVID-19 patients due to the relation with the respiratory system.Hypertension seems to be the most prevalent risk factor for myocardial injury in COVID-19 disease. It was reported in 58% of individuals with cardiac injury in a recent meta-analysis.Several cases of acute myocarditis associated with COVID-19 have been described around the globe and are diagnosed in multiple ways. Endomyocardial biopsy [EMB] remains the gold standard invasive technique in diagnosing myocarditis; however, due to the increased risk of infection, it is not done in COVID-19 patients.The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through ACE2 receptors present in heart tissue may be responsible for direct viral injury leading to myocarditis. Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism occurs in people transferred to intensive care units with COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis. A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19.Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart.

Tension (disambiguation) The various stressors listed above can all have events or stressors that range anywhere from minor to traumatic. Acute stress disorder is a psychological disorder where a traumatic event that is life threatening or threatens an injury causes a reaction of fear and helplessness lasting up to four weeks. Without proper attention, stress can produce severe effects on mental health and the immune system, which can eventually lead to effects on the physical body. Generally, stressors take many forms, such as: traumatic events, life demands, sudden medical emergencies, and daily inconveniences, to name a few. Biological responses to stressors
Traumatic events or any type of shock to the body can cause an acute stress response disorder (ASD). Depending on the situation our cells obtain more energy in order to combat any negative stressor and any other activity those cells are involved in seize. Research has found that if an individual is able to take some control over the stressor, then the level of stress will be decreased. 
   I do But they are hardly bad for you also Experimental ones sure   But vaccines save more lives then risk any day  The covid vaccine cause me to vomit and made me very poorly But I hadn't taken vets and my immune system was in tatters so meh [SEP] Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. There are several types of vaccines in use. But they may not be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and on rare occasions mutate to a virulent form and cause disease. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. 
  Nothing like that ..... Now the reason the vaccine will cause this it's a side effect when one takes the vaccine. Covid-19 does not cause erectile distinction. [SEP] The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question.

Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

"Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may directly cause psychiatric morbidity through cerebral infection or hyperinflammation [2]. Recovery in Long COVID is multi-faceted and we recommend mental health ". [SEP] The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that caused the pandemic of covid  disease is an example of a novel virus. Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. These "emergent" viruses are usually mutants of less harmful viruses that have circulated previously either in humans or other animals.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)  are caused by new types of coronaviruses. Other coronaviruses are known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of SARS infections—that by July 2003 had caused around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths—was unexpected and most countries were not prepared.A related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), thought to have originated in bats, emerged in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. Infections with the virus caused the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. See also

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and the activator of the transcription (STAT) pathway were at the centre of attention for driving hyperinflammation in COVID-19, i.e., the SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers hyperinflammation through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as differentiation of B cells and T cells progressing towards cytokine storm. 
No theoretical reason to believe COVID vaccine will cause harm to pregnant mothers or unborn child. https://t.co/xHtWkeGhKb [SEP] I'm more concerned about the safety of the vaccine than I am the side effects of the disease." According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. The highest concentration of nanoparticles was found at the injection site itself.COVID‑19 vaccination is safe for breastfeeding people. Specific populations
Based on the results of a preliminary study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated with the COVID‑19 vaccine.A statement by the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) reported that the two agencies had reached a conclusion that the vaccine is safe and effective in children aged between 12 and 15 years.On 19 May 2021, experts commissioned by the Norwegian Medicines Agency concluded that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the likely cause of ten deaths of frail elderly patients in Norwegian nursing homes. Pfizer and BioNTech announced on 18 February 2021 that the first participants received their first dose in this trial.A study published in March 2021, in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology came to the conclusion that messenger RNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were safe and effective at providing immunity against infection to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. In addition, the study reported that the occurrence and intensity of potential side effects in those undergoing pregnancy or lactating was very similar to those expected from non-pregnant populations, remaining generally very minor and well tolerated, mostly including injection site soreness, minor headaches, muscles aches or fatigue for a short period of time.In January 2021, Pfizer said it had finished enrolling 2,259 children aged between 12 and 15 years to study the vaccine's safety and efficacy. 
 Even Fauci the Gates mouthpiece admits masks do not protect you. Btw corona can get in your eyes, through cloth, on your clothes etc. The mask can recirculate bacteria in your body, affect your immune system, double your co2 intake, cause lung infections etc. Individual choice. [SEP] In the latter interview, Fauci said that COVID-19 could become a "global pandemic which would then have significant implications for" the United States.In March 2020, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.In a March 8, 2020, interview, Fauci stated that "right now in the United States, people [who are not infected] should not be walking around with masks", but "if you want to do it, that's fine". In the same interview, Fauci said that buying masks "could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need" them: "When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them". On April 3, the CDC reversed course, quoting recent studies that showed asymptomatic transmission of the virus, thus advocating for the public to wear non-surgical masks to reduce community transmission while Fauci advocated for wearing facial coverings in public. Fauci's shifting advice on wearing face masks drew criticism, which Fauci responded to by arguing that changes in policy were necessary as scientists learned more about COVID-19.In mid-April, when asked about social distancing and stay-at-home measures, Fauci said that if the administration had "started mitigation earlier" more lives could have been saved, and "no one is going to deny that." "When asked if the 2021 United States Capitol attack was a COVID-19 superspreader event, Fauci stated: "I think for those people there, they probably put themselves at an increased risk because they essentially did not adhere to the fundamentals of public health and COVID-19 context which is universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds in congregate settings. In mid-May 2021, Fauci said that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks outdoors, except for in "completely crowded situations". This guidance was updated in July 2021 to recommend that all people wear masks regardless of vaccination status, in what Fauci said was due to the much more contagious Delta variant.

  All vaccines have side effects and in a small % of cases even cause death  The chances of getting/dying from polio were higher than from the Vaccine. So it made sense to take the jab  When it comes to Covid, more children will be hospitalised/die from the vaccine than from Covid [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19.

 They already know for non-rna vaxs that Linked Epitope Suppression will likely cause Most Severe infection for subsequent exposure to Covid after vax (Aka Pathogenic Priming) same as seen wi Dengue vaccine.  They also know that novel RNA/DNA vaxs are likely to spike autoimmunity. [SEP] Epitope-based vaccines
The first epitope-based vaccine was developed in 1985 by Jacob et al. While epitope-based vaccines are generally safe, one possible side effect is cytokine storms. Large genetic studies have defined risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and genome sequences from 659 patients with severe COVID-19 revealed genetic variants that appear to be associated with life-threatening disease. Autoantibodies against type I IFNs were found in up to 13.7% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19, indicating that a complex interaction between genetics and the immune system is important for natural resistance to Covid.Similarly, mutations in the ERAP2 gene, encoding endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2, seem to increase the susceptibility to the plague, the disease caused by an infection with the bacteria Yersinia pestis. 'High risk' types of HPV cause almost all cervical cancers, as well as some anal, penile, and vulvar cancer. The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. Vaccination before initiation of sexual contact is advised to assure maximal protection. 
23. The claim that only (severe) #Covid_19 but not influenza may cause venous thrombosis and pulmonary (lung) embolism is not true, as it has been known for 50 years that severe influenza greatly increases the risk of thrombosis and embolism, too. [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and amphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution that tuberculosis (TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. Plasma erythropoietin levels often are lower in patients with IBD than expected, in conjunction with severe anemia.Thrombocytosis and thromboembolic events resulting from a hypercoagulable state in patients with IBD can lead to pulmonary embolism or thrombosis elsewhere in the body. 
A CDC panel says administering Johnson & Johnson shots would save many lives. It could cause about 24 cases of a rare and dangerous clotting disorder, but prevent 1,435 COVID-19 deaths, a CDC staffer and an analysis suggested. https://t.co/k49KoeeWfB [SEP] Vaccine Safety Monitoring Systems and Methods (CDC) a slide deck presented at October 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting Johnson & Johnson had worldwide sales of $93.8 billion during the calendar year 2021.Johnson & Johnson's brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies. Coronavirus (COVID-19) response
Johnson & Johnson committed over $1 billion toward the development of a not-for-profit COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Janssen COVID-19 vaccine
In June 2020, Johnson & Johnson and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) confirmed its intention to start a clinical trials of J&J's vaccine in September 2020, with the possibility of Phase 1/2a human clinical trials starting at an accelerated pace in the second half of July.On August 5, 2020, the US government agreed to pay more than $1 billion to Johnson and Johnson (medical device company) for the production of 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. As part of the agreed-upon deal, the U.S. can order up to 200 million additional doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson started its 60,000-person phase 3 adenovirus-based vaccine trial. A decisive event that occurred during Johnson's premiership was the COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020. Reuters reported that scientists were critical of Johnson both for acting too slowly to stop the spread of COVID-19 and for mishandling the government's response measures, and Politico quoted Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as saying that an earlier initial lockdown would have significantly lowered the death toll. In a phone call to President Vladimir Putin, Johnson urged him to "avoid bloodshed". 
    Exactly but its daft to put yourself in a position where in future life you could be classed as having a chronic illness  from a virus which is highly likely to cause some damage which would put you in a high risk category. you have the chance to protect yourself. Up to you !!! [SEP] A chronic condition (also known as chronic disease or chronic illness) is a health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects or a disease that comes with time. It is possible and not unexpected for an illness to change in definition from terminal to chronic. Some chronic conditions though, are caused by transmissible infections such as HIV/AIDS.63% of all deaths worldwide are from chronic conditions. Prevention
A growing body of evidence supports that prevention is effective in reducing the effect of chronic conditions; in particular, early detection results in less severe outcomes. Clinical preventive services include screening for the existence of the disease or predisposition to its development, counseling and immunizations against infectious agents. In contrast to their apparent cost in time and money, the benefits of preventive services are not directly perceived by patient because their effects are on the long term or might be greater for society as a whole than at the individual level.Therefore, public health programs are important in educating the public, and promoting healthy lifestyles and awareness about chronic diseases. The rising number of patient with chronic diseases has renewed the interest in prevention and its potential role in helping control costs. The guidelines emphasize that CBT for people with ME/CFS should not assume that unhelpful beliefs cause their illness, and should not be portrayed as curative. 
It’s still unknown how the vaccine could cause blood clots. One potential explanation is that some people develop an immune response that attacks platelets, making them clump together, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine tied to uncommon blood clots, experts.  https://t.co/peLyu8wX25 [SEP] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Covid-19 vaccination related enlargement of lymph node happens in 11.6% of those who received one dose of vaccine and in 16% of those received two doses.Experiments in mice show that intramuscular injections of lipid excipient nanoparticles (inactive substance that serves as the vehicle or medium) causes particles to enter the blood plasma and many organs with higher concentrations found in the liver, and lower concentrations in the spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. blood clots (thrombosis). These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). Microclots are small clumps of blood that form within the circulation, usually as a result of a larger thrombus breaking down into smaller pieces. The platelet activation can potentially cause a cascade, eventually leading to the formation of the thrombus. 
 Truly sorry to hear for your loss. However, the vaccination is NOT safe. It will not save you and will cause problems to your body. FDA has not yet approved any of Covid vaccines but said can be used for emergency purposes. There is a big difference. I do not trust the vaccine. [SEP] It is not approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year.The first disease people tried to prevent by inoculation was most likely smallpox, with the first recorded use of variolation occurring in the 16th century in China. Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. Safety
Vaccine development and approval
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently. During this stage, the vaccine's safety continues to be evaluated and researchers also gather data on the effectiveness and the ideal dose of the vaccine. Usage
The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination. In 2007, studies regarding the effectiveness of vaccines on mortality or morbidity rates of those exposed to various diseases have shown almost 100% decreases in death rates, and about a 90% decrease in exposure rates. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. 
    COVID attacks the lungs which causes inflammation, especially with people suffering from NCD's. The body responds to inflammation with a cykotine response, which causes, and I quote, significant changes in motor activity and motivation as well as anxiety, arousal, and alarm" [SEP] Cause
COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). Pathophysiology
The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19.Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. In severe cases, COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm which contributes to excessive and uncontrolled inflammation of organs, particularly respiratory tissues. 
 Yes, I'm doing the same, watching other countries. I have a rare autoimmune disease + take various immunosuppressants as my body is always fighting its own immune system. Understanding how Covid19 can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response resulting in a Cytokine storm /... [SEP] While treatment usually improves symptoms, they do not typically cure the disease.About 24 million (~7.5%) people in the United States are affected by an autoimmune disease. A person may have more than one autoimmune disease simultaneously and display symptoms of each. Analysis of large cohort data shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) is linked to a substantially increased risk of developing a diverse new-onset autoimmune diseases. A major understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been the application of genome-wide association studies that have identified a degree of genetic sharing among the autoimmune diseases.Autoimmunity, on the other hand, is the presence of self-reactive immune response (e.g., auto-antibodies, self-reactive T cells), with or without damage or pathology resulting from it. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in the US from the 1980s to present day, have shown an increase of antinuclear antibodies, a common biomarker for autoimmune diseases. This shows that there has been an increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in recent years pointing to a stronger influence of environment factors as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases. Prevalence
Prevalence of some common autoimmune diseases, which varies geographically, is listed below. Autoimmune diseases qualifiers
Overview of the qualifiers for the list. 
  Pneumonia and bronchitis are inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria or viruses, including the virus which causes COVID. So your statement really doesn't make much sense as pneumonia and bronchitis are both possible symptoms of COVID. [SEP] The severity of the condition is variable.Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia. Classification
Pneumonitis refers to lung inflammation; pneumonia refers to pneumonitis, usually due to infection but sometimes non-infectious, that has the additional feature of pulmonary consolidation. Many people with chronic bronchitis also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is normally caused by a viral infection. Other pathogens such as viruses and fungi can cause pneumonia, for example severe acute respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 and pneumocystis pneumonia. Influenza may progress to pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus or by a subsequent bacterial infection. Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or by a secondary bacterial infection. 
Covid-19 vaccines initiates an early and progressive clotting of blood in the lungs (pulmonary thrombosis) which impairs blood supply and gas exchange at lungs, leading to respiratory failure, which in majority of cases cause death. [SEP] Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
Up to half of hospitalized COVID patients have elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, or antibodies that cause blood clots to form. Patients with these antibodies are much more likely to have severe respiratory disease and kidney injury. #COVID19 [SEP] A low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation, they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea, or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. From 1993 to 2012, there have been an increased number of admissions in hospitals due to pulmonary embolisms, jumping from 23 cases per 100,000 people to 65 cases per 100,000 people. Signs and symptoms
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy-related complications does not indicate APS (see below for the diagnosis of APS). Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. Clinically important antiphospholipid antibodies (those that arise as a result of the autoimmune process) are associated with thrombosis and vascular disease. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies bind to prothrombin, thus increasing its cleavage to thrombin, its active form.In APS there are also antibodies binding to protein S, which is a co-factor of protein C. Thus, anti-protein S antibodies decrease protein C efficiency.Annexin A5 forms a shield around negatively charged phospholipid molecules, thus reducing their availability for coagulation. Anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with thrombosis at moderate to high titres (over 40 GPLU or MPLU). Patients with both lupus anticoagulant antibodies and moderate or high titre anticardiolipin antibodies show a greater risk of thrombosis than with one alone.The increased risks of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth by antiphospholipid antibodies, as supported by in vitro studies, include decreased trophoblast viability, syncytialization and invasion, deranged production of hormones and signalling molecules by trophoblasts, as well as activation of coagulation and complement pathways. 
   Along those same lines, if my loved one dies straight after getting a covid vaccination, can I get the hospital to state the cause of death was the vaccine?  If it's good for COVID then it must be good for the vaccines as well?   #COVID19Aus #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine #uspol [SEP] Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.Most vaccines are administered before a patient has contracted a disease to help increase future protection. The term "vaccine failure" does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is defective. Safety
Vaccine development and approval
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently. In 2007, studies regarding the effectiveness of vaccines on mortality or morbidity rates of those exposed to various diseases have shown almost 100% decreases in death rates, and about a 90% decrease in exposure rates. This is a false assumption, since diseases held in check by immunization programs can and do still return if immunization is dropped. That is vaccinated children are less likely to die but no causal link has been found. Vaccination during illness
Many parents are concerned about the safety of vaccination when their child is sick. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends healthcare providers directly address parental concerns about vaccines when questioned about their efficacy and safety. 
Chronic stress could cause problems for your baby. These can include effects on your unborn baby’s growth and the length of gestation.[NEWLINE]#healthdisparities #blacklivesmatter #covid #publichealth #health #socialdeterminantsofhealth #healthequity https://t.co/4JgSKue9tQ [SEP] Since chronic stress is due to a wide variety of environmental, nutritional, chemical, pathological, or genetic factors, a wide range of physiological systems can be damaged. Prolonged stress can disturb the immune, digestive, cardiovascular, sleep, and reproductive systems. When the stress is chronic, it will lead to sustained elevated blood pressure, impairing the heart functions. Research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong effects on the biological, psychological, and behavioral responses to stress later in life. Development
Chronic stress has also been shown to impair developmental growth in children by lowering the pituitary gland's production of growth hormone, as in children associated with a home environment involving serious marital discord, alcoholism, or child abuse. Severe chronic stress for long periods of time can lead to an increased chance of catching illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, depression, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Stress may contribute to various disorders, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, as well as other mental illnesses and functional somatic syndromes. prenatal exposure to maternal stress, poor attachment histories, sexual abuse) are thought to contribute to deficits in the maturity of an individual's stress response systems. 
 I've heard heart disease and cancer death tolls down 50-60% because if patient tested positive for Covid 19, Covid 19 was reported as their cause of death.  Is this true? [SEP] Deaths
As of 10 March 2023, more than 6.88 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.In May 2022, the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14.9 million compared to 5.4 million reported COVID-19 deaths, with the majority of the unreported 9.5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus, rather than indirect deaths. 17 November marked the three-year anniversary since health officials in China first detected COVID-19.On 11 November, the WHO reported that deaths since the month of February had dropped 90 percent. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. 20 January
A further 1,820 deaths are reported of people who died within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19, the highest daily figure so far, and bringing the total to 93,290. 21 January
A further 1,290 deaths are reported within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19. 26 January
A further 1,631 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive COVID diagnosis take the total number of deaths recorded by the government past 100,000 to 100,162, though figures released by the Office for National Statistics suggest the 100,000 figure was surpassed in the week to 15 January, when the cumulative number reached 104,000. Official figures show the number of COVID deaths in England and Wales has fallen by 92% since January 2021, while weekly deaths are 5% below the five year average. 
Fact: The COVID-19 vaccine will NOT give you #COVID19. None of the vaccines currently in development or use in the U.S. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. But, as the #vaccine helps you build #immunity, the process can sometimes cause symptoms, such as a fever. https://t.co/SJV4eGWDAj [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. Authorized and approved vaccines have shown the following efficacies:

Effectiveness
Evidence from vaccine use during the pandemic shows vaccination can reduce infection and is most effective at preventing severe COVID-19 symptoms and death, but is less good at preventing mild COVID-19. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". 
     Let's all get one thing straight:  The virus in question is a beta-coronavirus called SARS-COV-2. It itself is a variant of SARS-COV, and related to MERS-COV.  The virus is claimed to cause a recognized (yet disputed) list of symptoms. This list is known as COVID-19. [SEP] Instead, it is more likely it was caused by human parasites such as fleas and lice. Specialized malware designed to attack those systems do exist. Disease and preventive healthcare
The common cold and the common flu are caused by viruses, not cold temperature, although cold temperature may somewhat weaken the immune system, and someone already infected with a cold or influenza virus but showing no symptoms can become symptomatic after they are exposed to low temperatures. Viruses are more likely to spread during the winter for a variety of reasons such as dry air, less air circulation in homes, people spending more time indoors, and lower vitamin D levels in humans. Warts on human skin are caused by human papillomavirus, which is unique to humans. It is prescribed for fevers and convulsions, a treatment not supported by evidence-based medicine. The implementation of protective sequestration did prevent the virus from spreading outside a single household after a single carrier came into the town while it was in effect, but it was not sustainable and had to be lifted in February 1919. A month later, the flu killed five residents and infected dozens of others. 
“Patients brought into hospital with heart attack symptoms have later been found to be suffering from cardiac inflammation caused by the virus...it can begin as a kidney infection, or as meningitis, before going on to cause respiratory problems.” #COVID19  https://t.co/tlVDUjp8Q8 [SEP] A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in the coronary artery of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. Pain
Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Similarly, chest pain similar to a previous heart attack is also suggestive. Women having heart attacks are more likely to have palpitations, back pain, labored breath, vomiting, and left arm pain than men, although the studies showing these differences had high variability. Women are less likely to report chest pain during a heart attack and more likely to report nausea, jaw pain, neck pain, cough, and fatigue, although these findings are inconsistent across studies. Women with heart attacks also had more indigestion, dizziness, loss of appetite, and loss of consciousness. Extremes of temperature are also associated.A number of acute and chronic infections including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, influenza, Helicobacter pylori, and Porphyromonas gingivalis among others have been linked to atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. "Heart Failure and Cardiogenic Shock After Myocardial Infarction". 
 Polio vaccine underwent the largest clinical trial for its time.  COVID passed through the EUA process.   Science is telling us two of the vaccines cause blood clots.  People are allowed to make logical judgements on what they do or dont put in their body. [SEP] In 2017, cases caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outnumbered wild poliovirus cases for the first time, due to wild polio cases hitting record lows. With wild polio cases at record lows, 2017 was the first year where more cases of cVDPV were recorded than the wild poliovirus, a trend that is expected to continue.To combat this, the WHO in 2016, decided to switch from the trivalent polio vaccine to the bivalent polio vaccine. United States
Under the FDA, the process of establishing evidence for vaccine clinical safety and efficacy is the same as for the approval process for prescription drugs. Viral vector vaccines were also developed for the COVID‑19 pandemic after the technology was previously cleared for Ebola.As multiple COVID‑19 vaccines have been authorized or licensed for use, real-world vaccine effectiveness (RWE) is being assessed using case control and observational studies. Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID‑19 vaccine. Other types
Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include virus-like particle vaccines, multiple DNA plasmid vaccines, at least two lentivirus vector vaccines, a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein.Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‑19 infections. A variety of intranasal COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. Planning and development
Since January 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.Multiple steps along the entire development path are evaluated, including:
the level of acceptable toxicity of the vaccine (its safety),
targeting vulnerable populations,
the need for vaccine efficacy breakthroughs,
the duration of vaccination protection,
special delivery systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection),
dose regimen,
stability and storage characteristics,
emergency use authorization before formal licensing,
optimal manufacturing for scaling to billions of doses, and
dissemination of the licensed vaccine. 
I know no system is perfect, so I share this with that in mind - Getting #COVID in #EmergencyRooms - I found only one small study that says low risk.  More #research needs to be done, as this was the cause in my family! [NEWLINE]I beg to differ! [NEWLINE]https://t.co/HEeEWQyH75 https://t.co/AXWgzLhwWD [SEP] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" In September 2020, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results". Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.The first COVID‑19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December 2020 by the UK medicines regulator MHRA. Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes. There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.As of December 2020, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID‑19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy. National Guidance for post-COVID syndrome assessment clinics (Report). Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January 2020 were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors, including new COVID-19 variants.

   The 10,000 deaths are those caused by Covid alone, excluding anyone who may have had cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure or any other number of preexisting conditions.  The 200,000 is a real number that is still climbing.  Time to re-educate yourself. [SEP] Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. As of 22 June 2023, the pandemic had caused 768,186,332 cases and 6,945,701 confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest pandemics in history. Deaths
As of 10 March 2023, more than 6.88 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 16.5 to 26.8 million (≈20.2 million) by 3 February 2023 by The Economist, as well as over 18.5 million by 1 April 2023 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and ≈18.2 million (earlier) deaths between 1 January 2020, and 31 December 2021, by a comprehensive international study. Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.In May 2022, the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14.9 million compared to 5.4 million reported COVID-19 deaths, with the majority of the unreported 9.5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus, rather than indirect deaths. Some deaths were because people with other conditions could not access medical services.A December 2022 WHO study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during 2020 and 2021, again concluding ≈14.8 million excess early deaths occurred, reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them, addressing criticisms. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. On 13 May 2020, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of COVID-19 infection with 23,091 deaths. 
In a few decades there's gonna be a section in history books about the #pandemicbabies that caused a spike in the population similar to the #babyboomers after ww2. #pandemic #COVID19 #coronavirus #StayHome #Quarantine [SEP] and helping to stop the Chimera Ants. Prevention of complications
Postpartum infection is one of the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. A caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity, estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high, and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections was found by a meta-analysis to substantially reduce the incidence of febrile morbidity. Frequency
Global rates of caesarean section are increasing. It doubled from 2003 to 2018 to reach 21%, and is increasing annually by 4%. Caesarean rates in the U.S. have risen considerably since 1996. The rate has increased in the United States, to 33% of all births in 2012, up from 21% in 1996. Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an information explosion. 
Stop calling it a vaccine!! Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick.

Mpox
Commencement: 2022. The WHO ended its PHEIC declaration on 5 May 2023, but as of 2 June 2023 continues to refer to it as a pandemic. By August 2021, the pandemic's fifth wave peaked, with more than 400 deaths in 1 day.COVID-19 was confirmed in South Korea on 20 January 2020. Transition to endemic phase
In June 2022, an article in Human Genomics said that the pandemic was still "raging", but that "now is the time to explore the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. Future generations of COVID-19 vaccines that may target more and conserved genomic regions will also act as an insurance against the manifestation of catastrophic scenarios concerning the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 are not like influenza vaccines, but rather are using "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms.

   Getting Covid causes your body to make antibodies against the virus (probably more than one type).  The vaccine cause the body to make one very specific antibody.  This mixed immunity is probably very good [SEP] Cost-effectiveness
Commonly used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health, compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease. Vaccines pose a very small immunologic load compared to the pathogens naturally encountered by a child in a typical year; common childhood conditions such as fevers and middle-ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines, and studies have shown that vaccinations, even multiple concurrent vaccinations, do not weaken the immune system or compromise overall immunity. However, strength and duration of immune protection gained varies by both disease and vaccine, with some vaccines giving better protection than natural infection. For example, the HPV vaccine generates better immune protection than natural infection due to the vaccine containing higher concentrations of a viral coat protein, while also not containing proteins the HPV viruses use to inhibit immune response.While it is true that infection with certain illnesses may produce lifelong immunity, many natural infections do not produce lifelong immunity, while carrying a higher risk of harming a person's health than vaccines. 5 April
COVID-19 pandemic: Preclinical data for a new vaccine developed at the Medical University of Vienna indicates it is effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants known to date, including Omicron. Researchers, health organizations and regulators are discussing, investigating and partly recommending COVID-19 vaccine boosters that mix the original vaccine formulation with Omicron-adjusted parts – such as spike proteins of a specific Omicron subvariant – to better prepare the immune system to recognize a wide variety of variants amid substantial and ongoing immune evasion by Omicron. The CDC reports that despite prevalence of the Delta variant people vaccinated against COVID-19 are ~11 times less likely to die from COVID-19 (age-standardized rates of 1.6 versus 0.1 and 1.1 versus 0.1 weekly deaths per 100,000 U.S. citizens), showing vaccines' effectiveness at preventing severe disease. Studies, some of which using large nationwide datasets from either Israel and Denmark, find that vaccine effectiveness of multiple common two-dosed COVID-19 vaccines is substantially lower against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant than for other common variants including the Delta variant, and that a new (often a third) dose – a booster dose – is needed and effective, with it i.a. 
   No you cannot get sticker from wearing your mask. It says that if you have moderate to severe asthma that covid-19 can exacerbate things and possibly cause pneumonia [SEP] A sticker is a type of  label: a piece of printed paper, plastic, vinyl, or other material with temporary or permanent pressure sensitive adhesive on one side. The term "sticker price" refers to the historic practice of adhering a large sticker to the window of a new car listing its base price, options, shipping charges, etc. Stickers placed on automobile bumpers, magnetic and permanent, called bumper stickers, are often used by individuals as a way of demonstrating support for political or ideological causes. Identification of vehicle registration and last service details are two examples of stickers on the inside of most car windscreens. In the 16th century French aristocracy wore stickers on their face to hide blemishes.Temporary stickers are used today to indicate whether someone is free of certain health symptoms, been vaccinated, or otherwise cleared some security protocol. Stickers are also printed to use it as a temporary tattoos. Sticker is the third Korean-language and fourth overall studio album by South Korean boy band NCT 127. Sticker was officially released on September 17, and the group promoted the album and its title track on The Late Late Show with James Corden. 
    Zitat aus obigem Artikel: „But there’s no evidence currently that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune disease or make it worse... . At the moment there’s every reason to suggest that people with autoimmune diseases ought to get either of these vaccines when they get rolled out.”“ [SEP] An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to messenger RNA vaccines. The advantages of mRNA vaccines over traditional vaccines are ease of design, speed and lower cost of production, the induction of both cellular and humoral immunity, and lack of interaction with the genomic DNA. Another biological advantage of mRNA vaccines is that since the antigens are produced inside the cell, they stimulate cellular immunity, as well as humoral immunity.mRNA vaccines have the production advantage that they can be designed swiftly. DNA vaccines
In addition to sharing the advantages of theoretical DNA vaccines over established traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines also have additional advantages over DNA vaccines. However, those susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to mRNA vaccines. "The tangled history of mRNA vaccines". External links

  If it's unclear it can't be reported.  The death has to be contributed from Covid because Covid causes the respiratory issues etc that cause the death, Covid caused it.  Like lung cancer if death because their lung stopped functioning because of cancer they died from lung cancer. [SEP] However, the people in these videos are generally believed to have been suffering from something other than COVID-19, such as one who was drunk.A video from February 2020 purported to be of dead COVID-19 victims in China was actually a video from Shenzhen of people sleeping on the street. Incidence and mortality
Correctly reporting the number of people who were sick or who had died was difficult, especially during the earliest days of the pandemic. In China
Chinese under-reporting during early 2020
Leaked documents show that China's public reporting of cases gave an incomplete picture during the early stages of the pandemic. A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.The U.S. experienced 882,000 "excess deaths" (i.e., deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years) between February 2020 and January 2022, which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID-19 during that period (835,000 deaths). Analysis of weekly data from each U.S. state shows that the calculated excess deaths are strongly correlated with COVID-19 infections, undercutting the notion that the deaths were primarily caused by some factor other than the disease. The article also suggested that deaths attributed to cardiac and respiratory diseases in infected persons were incorrectly categorized as deaths due to COVID-19. Many of these causes of death are unnoticed due to the often limited information on death certificates. Since diagnosis in pediatric patients is difficult, large number of cases are not properly reported.

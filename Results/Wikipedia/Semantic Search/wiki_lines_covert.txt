   Many of the covid vaccines are more likely to cause side effects compared to your normal flu shot. Here is the data for 1st and 2nd doses.   Side effects don't mean it's bad for you. It means it's working. That's how the immune system works.  Source:  https://t.co/hFv7q9slPh https://t.co/2LjZ6lXmrV [SEP] There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Safety
Side effects
Common side effects of vaccination include local injection-site reactions and cold-like symptoms. Inactivated flu vaccines cannot cause influenza and are regarded as safe during pregnancy.While side effects of the flu vaccine may occur, they are usually minor, including soreness, redness, and swelling around the point of injection, headache, fever, nausea or fatigue. Side effects of a nasal spray vaccine may include runny nose, wheezing, sore throat, cough, or vomiting.In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. While minor side effects, such as soreness or low grade fever, are relatively common, serious side effects are very rare and occur in about 1 out of every 100,000 vaccinations and typically involve allergic reactions that can cause hives or difficulty breathing.However, vaccines are the safest they ever have been in history and each vaccine undergoes rigorous clinical trials to ensure their safety and efficacy before approval by authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Prior to human testing, vaccines are tested on cell cultures and the results modelled to assess how they will interact with the immune system. Side effects
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects. It is unclear whether a higher degree of reactogenicity to a vaccine correlates with more severe adverse events, which would require hospitalization or are life-threatening. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. 
 The S1 spike protein used in the Covid vaccine may be toxic to endothelial cells. Likely the cause of the clotting problems we are seeing from people who get the vaccine.  https://t.co/ZCepuEfWCD [SEP] She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. The study included 294 participants who presented with symptoms of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after receipt of the first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, showing an independent association between baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". It shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone can cause vascular disease and could explain some covid-19 patients who suffered from strokes, or other vascular problems in other parts of human body at the same time. Spike proteins were said to be dangerously "cytotoxic" and mRNA vaccines containing them therefore in themselves dangerous. Spike proteins were also said to be "shed" by vaccinated people, in an erroneous allusion to the phenomenon of vaccine-induced viral shedding, which is a rare effect of live-virus vaccines unlike those used for COVID-19. 
  And the Covid vaccine can’t knock out all the variants either.   So once again, we are taking a vaccine with known risks that STILL doesn’t let us leave our basements or take off our double masks. But it does cause blood clots, so there’s that. [SEP] The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. COVID‑19 is a very serious disease with high hospitalization and death rates and every day COVID is still causing thousands of deaths across the EU. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". Syndrome identification
A number of COVID‑19 vaccines began to become approved and available at scale in December 2020, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up at scale from the beginning of 2021, among them the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, based on an adenovirus vector and internally termed AZD1222.On 11 March 2021, the EMA issued a statement noting Denmark had suspended AZD1222 vaccinations due to a vaccinated patient dying with blood clots. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine.

4. Vaccines have other heavy metals along with nano particles that are excellent conductors for frequencies being beamed down. The reason chronically ill have most covid deaths b/c severe Gut damage is cause of most chronic illness, allowing particles into blood stream... [SEP] Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains 32 micrograms of pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated with CRM197 (a diphtheria toxin).Another variant is the RNA vaccine, which contains mRNA embedded in lipid (fat) nanoparticles. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. assorted factors such as ethnicity, age, or genetic predisposition.If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated cases.Important considerations in an effective vaccination program:
careful modeling to anticipate the effect that an immunization campaign will have on the epidemiology of the disease in the medium to long term
ongoing surveillance for the relevant disease following introduction of a new vaccine
maintenance of high immunization rates, even when a disease has become rareIn 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. Attenuated, or live, weakened, vaccines typically provoke more durable immunological responses. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. 
 People literally believe that the world is flat, 5G networks caused covid and that vaccines cause autism. This is par for the course… [SEP] Anti-vaccination activists and other people in many countries have spread a variety of unfounded conspiracy theories and other misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines based on misunderstood or misrepresented science, religion, and law. Socially based claims
Claims about a vaccine before one existed
Multiple social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that in the early stages of the pandemic, the virus was known and that a vaccine was already available. Public opinion
In December 2020 a poll of 1,115 U.S. adults found 12% of respondents believed there is evidence vaccinations cause autism; 51% believed there is no evidence; and 37% did not know. A high proportion of internet sources on the topic are "inaccurate on the whole" which can lead people searching for information to form "significant misconceptions about vaccines".Although opposition to vaccination has existed for centuries, the internet and social media have recently facilitated the spread of vaccine-related misinformation. Another study showed that a predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories was negatively correlated to the intention of individuals to get vaccinated.Spreading vaccine misinformation can lead to financial rewards by posting on social media and asking for donations or fundraising for anti-vaccination causes. Vaccination as genocide
Misinformation that forced vaccination could be used to "depopulate" the earth circulated in 2011 by misquoting Bill Gates. Through the spread of false media, civilians are blindly being led to believe that vaccinations are the leading cause of autism, when in fact, this is far from the truth. People are likely to filter any new information they receive to fit their preexisting worldview – corrective vaccine facts are no exception to this motivated reasoning. 
   That makes no sense.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If they have done so much work already why have they never got rid of the common cold.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid is noting like any other virus. Which other virus causes hair loss, skin irritations and lasts 6-12 months in people?  Only one thing does that.  Radiation!!! [SEP] Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses, and there is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Antibiotics and antivirals
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. Research directions
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. Societal impact
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. 
Know the facts! There is no evidence that #COVID19 #vaccines cause #infertility, says   &  https://t.co/c1u4QONH4b #NIAW2021 #InfertilityAwareness [SEP] A French virologist likewise falsely claimed that antibodies from vaccines had created and strengthened COVID-19 variants through a previously debunked theory of Antibody-dependent Enhancement.A related debunked theory, out of India, claimed that COVID-19 vaccines were lowering people's ability to withstand new variants instead of boosting immunity.The website Natural News published an article in July 2021 claiming that CDC director Rochelle Walensky admitted that COVID-19 vaccines do not protect against the delta variant and that vaccinated people could be superspreaders due to having a higher viral load. Medical claims
Claims of inefficacy
Recurrent claims, based on misinterpretation of statistical data, have been made regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Reproductive health
In a December 2020 petition to the European Medicines Agency, German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and British researcher Michael Yeadon suggested, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines could cause infertility in women by targeting the syncytin-1 protein necessary for placenta formation. A study in Andrologia found that Google searches relating to a supposed link between vaccination against COVID-19 and adverse effects on fertility increased following the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID vaccines in the United States, indicating that concerns about alleged impacts on fertility are a major contributor to vaccine hesitancy. A study conducted on 44 rats injected with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at doses over 300 times the human dose by body weight and 44 rats injected with placebo found no statistically significant evidence of any adverse effects on the fertility of female rats or on the health of the offspring of rats (the 3% lower pregnancy rate found in the vaccine group was not statistically significant). Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States "can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy". Polio vaccine as a claimed COVID-19 carrier
Social media posts in Cameroon pushed a conspiracy theory that polio vaccines contained COVID-19, further complicating polio eradication beyond the logistical and funding difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contained tissue from aborted fetuses. 
  So, they die from lung failure caused by extreme pneumonia or heart failure from sludgy blood but the root cause is #COVID19 (which can be confirmed post-mortem) so the death is counted as due to the #coronavirus & NOT due to “natural” causes of pneumonia or heart attack ... /3 [SEP] Background
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. It is a major cause of death among all age groups, resulting in 1.4 million deaths in 2010 (7% of the world's yearly total) and 3.0 million deaths in 2016 (the 4th leading cause of death in the world).There are various causes of pneumonia including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Pneumonia is the second most common hospital-acquired disease, while also being the leading cause of death among hospital-acquired infections. Out of all deaths of children age five and under in 2017, pneumonia was the cause of 15%, killing more children than any other infectious disease. S. pneumoniae appears to be the most prominent cause of infection, although it's unclear as to whether bacterial and viral co-infection plays a larger role in infecting children.It is the leading cause of death among children in low income countries. Community acquired pneumonia causes more deaths in Europe than any other single infectious agent. Lung infarction occurs when an artery to the lung becomes blocked and part of the lung dies. It is most often caused by pulmonary embolism. 
“It’s unclear if his death was related to the virus.” This is why we perform autopsies. There is a significant likelihood that #COVID19 played a role in that it is known to affect endothelial cells & has been shown to cause neurological symptoms including stroke. https://t.co/FeaX5KMPC4 [SEP] About 35% of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 experience neurological complications. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Neuropathological studies of COVID-19 victims show microthrombi and cerebral infarctions. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. She is noted for her early autopsies of COVID-19 victims that significantly contributed to the identification of long-term effects of the novel coronavirus. However, when Fowkes and her team performed autopsies on patients, they found that the virus had affected not only the lungs but also other vital organs, leading the team to believe that the virus had probably traversed the body through endothelial cells through the blood vessels.

  COVID infection can cause a huge drop in sperm counts and infertility. The vaccine has not been associated with this. Vaccine safer than COVID for make fertility. [SEP] Lowered effective fertility related to reproductive toxicity relates to both male and female effects alike and is reflected in decreased sperm counts, semen quality and ovarian failure. COVID-19 infection in pregnancy is associated with several pregnancy complications. Effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis in 2021, COVID-19 is associated with stillbirth, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. However vaccination against COVID-19 was not associated with an increase in miscarriage or reduction in live birth. The specific use of the term "vaccine shedding" has risen to public prominence through anti-vaccine activists linked to misinformation related to COVID-19, who erroneously claim that COVID-19 vaccination can cause individuals to shed coronavirus spike protein and affect menstruation and fertility in women exposed to them. However, the spike protein generated by vaccination does not shed, and there is no evidence to suggest that these vaccines cause menstruation and fertility problems. Vaccination also cannot cause shedding of the COVID-19 virus since none of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use by the FDA or the World Health Organization as of December 2021 are live-virus vaccines. As CVSTs are more likely in women using hormonal contraceptives, this inherent risk factor may be an influence on the reported preponderance of women experiencing these events following vaccination. 
 Severe Covid is a systemic disease not just confined to resp system.. causes hyper inflammation,clotting, encephalopathy etc..we need all hands on deck from generalists to specialists, nurses, ward attendants [SEP] Most affected children will need intensive care.All affected children have persistent fever. In May 2020, the International Council of Nurses reported that at least 90,000 healthcare workers have been infected and more than 260 nurses had died in the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the proper staffing to handle the influx of Covid patients nurses can not provide patients with the best care. Not only do these nurses have to deal with the added stress of being overworked, but they are also falling victim to the virus as well. Nurses are the publics’ defense in the pandemic, but because of the lacking resources, the nurses cannot totally protect themselves or provide the best patient care. In one experiment scientists reported that “more than 28% of the sample reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, except for other non-COVID healthcare workers” In addition more than 50% of the sample reported low levels of depersonalization, except for COVID nurses and physicians, who reported high levels of depersonalization in 36.73% of the cases. Covid-19 has changed the way nurses care for patients, many patients needed to have virtual appointments rather than face to face care because of nurses caring for patients with Covid-19. Recommendations
World Health Organization
The World Health Organization has given the following key recommendations to decrease the spread of COVID-19 among healthcare workers:
Training healthcare workers to identify respiratory diseases
Providing increased access to personal protective equipment
Providing psychological support to health workers
Routinely conducting hospital surveillance
Recognizing that every healthcare system can have gaps

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance on preventing transmission and reducing job stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for healthcare workers:

Infection prevention
Implement telehealth protocols where possible
Screen ever one entering a healthcare facility for COVID-19 symptoms
Use appropriate face coverings dependent upon the procedure (i.e. 
Immunologist warns Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s  https://t.co/e41d3OssWU [SEP] All seven of the known human coronaviruses are neurotropic, the common cold viruses mainly in vulnerable populations while the more virulent SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 frequently attack the nervous systems (primarily in animal models).Those causing latent infection include herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses. Ponezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Ponezumab was developed by Pfizer Inc. Common symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease include: memory loss, confusion, and mood changes.As Alzheimer's disease affects around 55 million patients globally and accounts for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases, billions of dollars are spent yearly towards research to better understand the biological mechanisms of the disease as well as develop effective therapeutic treatments for it. These introduced mutations or over-expression of human Alzheimer's associated genes, can lead these animals to additionally display cognitive impairment, deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP), synaptic loss, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by two hallmarks: senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangle. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are widespread throughout brain tissue and mirror other pathological changes associated with AD. Even individuals with mild cognitive impairment, the phase between normal aging and early dementia, have increased oxidative damage in their nuclear and mitochondrial brain DNA (see Aging brain).

Is It Safe to Take a COVID-19 Vaccine?  Yes. Contrary to some rumors floating around, the COVID-19 vaccines are tested and safe for use. Aside from mild side effects, vaccines do not cause long-term health complications. To know more, talk to us.  #VijayPatelMD #COVID19Vaccine https://t.co/HoRRWvAUN7 [SEP] The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). COVID-19 vaccination is safe for people who are breastfeeding.As of 18 June 2023, 13.42 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Studies in animals found no safety concerns and clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines in pregnant women. 
   Covid causes myocarditis much more frequently than a vaccine. [SEP] Infections
The most common causes of myocarditis are infectious organisms. Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 vaccination was observed to be highest in males between 16–29 years of age, and after receiving the second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis may result from a direct viral infection of the myocardium. In addition, the incidence of myopericarditis is significantly higher with a smallpox vaccination in comparison with a COVID-19 vaccination. Research demonstrates patients infected with influenza as well as Covid are over twice as likely to die as patients with only Covid. 
Nina unqualified Twitter doctors [NEWLINE]STOP advising COVID positive people to not go to hospital when their symptoms worsen & breathing gets hard[NEWLINE]Hypoxia (less oxygen in your blood/tissue) can & will cause damage to their brain cells. Hence most COVID survivors experience memory loss [SEP] Causes
One theory relating to COVID-19 presentation suggests the impaired processing of severe hypoxia and resumption of normal breathing may be due to the neurological pathway by which the virus spreads from the oral cavity to the brain. Cases of silent hypoxia with COVID-19 have been reported for patients who did not experience shortness of breath or coughing until their oxygen levels had depressed to such a degree that they were at risk of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and organ failure. Recent research suggests this may be due to an autoimmune response caused by carbon monoxide-induced changes in the myelin sheath surrounding neurons.If hypoxia results in coma, the length of unconsciousness is often indicative of long-term damage. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. but under conditions when there is insufficient oxygen available, increased blood flow may not be sufficient to compensate, and hypoxia can result in brain injury. 
   Hypercapnia is a condition that can be easily corrected by your own body, or presents over days/hours due to underlying issues with your lungs caused by things like smoking damage, morbid obesity or - guess what - Covid 19.[NEWLINE]You can avoid Hyoercapnia by using a face covering. [SEP] Hypercapnia (from the Greek hyper = "above" or "too much" and kapnos = "smoke"), also known as hypercarbia and CO2 retention, is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. Acute hypercapnia is called acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) and is a medical emergency as it generally occurs in the context of acute illness. Hypercapnia is a hazard of underwater diving associated with breath-hold diving, scuba diving, particularly on rebreathers, and deep diving where it is associated with increased breathing gas density due to the high ambient pressure. Hypercapnia also occurs when the breathing gas is contaminated with carbon dioxide, or respiratory gas exchange cannot keep up with the metabolic production of carbon dioxide, which can occur when gas density limits ventilation at high ambient pressures.In severe hypercapnia (generally

Hypercapnia is generally caused by hypoventilation, lung disease, or diminished consciousness. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. Hypercapnia is generally defined as an arterial blood carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Terminology
Hypercapnia is the opposite of hypocapnia, the state of having abnormally reduced levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. 
 Out of the 3,000,000+ doses that were administered, 6 women got blood clots.  There are lots of medicines that cause this very rare side effect, and being vaccinated against COVID should be worth the risk. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated [SEP] Signs and symptoms
The thrombosis events associated with the COVID‑19 vaccine may occur 4–28 days after its administration and mainly affects women under 55. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. Vaccination campaign responses
Early reports of the events of concern seemed to indicate the presentation rate for the specific blood clots of concern might be higher for women of younger ages, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found examples across all genders and ages, their data skewing towards these specific blood clots being more prevalent in AZD1222 vaccinated persons of younger ages.The WHO has continued to stress the administration of vaccines is based on risk versus benefit analysis. Most individuals do not require treatment but do need to be cautious during periods when the possibility of blood clotting are increased; for example, during pregnancy, after surgery, or during long flights. 
With the uncertainties associated with #COVID, many people have turned to food as a coping mechanism. Eating due to boredom or stress may provide temporary satisfaction. However, over time, this can cause weight gain and emotional distress. Read more 👉 https://t.co/cxvKKTkIiy [SEP] While the term commonly refers to eating as a means of coping with negative emotions, it sometimes include eating for positive emotions, such as overeating when celebrating an event or to enhance an already good mood. Those who eat as a coping strategy are at an especially high risk of developing binge-eating disorder, and those with eating disorders are at a higher risk to engage in emotional eating as a means to cope. Giving in to a craving or eating because of stress can cause feelings of regret, shame, or guilt, and these responses tend to be associated with emotional hunger. Major theories behind eating to cope
Current research suggests that certain individual factors may increase one's likelihood of using emotional eating as a coping strategy. Those who experience this biologically instigated increase in appetite during times of stress are therefore primed to rely on emotional eating as a coping mechanism. Numerous studies — granted, many of them in animals — have shown that physical or emotional distress increases the intake of food high in fat, sugar, or both, even in the absence of caloric deficits. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible for stress-induced eating, as research shows high cortisol reactivity is associated with hyperphagia, an abnormally increased appetite for food, during stress. Therefore, those whose lifestyles or careers entail frequent intermittent stressors over prolonged periods of time thus have greater biological incentive to develop patterns of emotional eating, which puts them at risk for long-term adverse health consequences such as weight gain or cardiovascular disease. 
  The vaccine has a higher survival rate yet conspiracy nutjobs freak out about that. See how it's disingenuous to focus only on survival rate? You're ignoring those critically ill - which included Boris in ICU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignore death statistics, look up the damage covid causes your body. https://t.co/1yTsjreJfm [SEP] Anti-vaccination activists and other people in many countries have spread a variety of unfounded conspiracy theories and other misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines based on misunderstood or misrepresented science, religion, and law. Misinformation
Various false theories have spread in different parts of the world regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. A frequent fallacy consisted in concluding on the ineffectiveness (or low effectiveness) of vaccines after noticing the apparently high proportion of vaccinated patients among COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths, without taking into account the high proportion of vaccinated people among the general population, thus committing the base rate fallacy; or without taking into account the tendency of people at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 to be vaccinated in priority, thus ignoring the Yule–Simpson effect.In the United Kingdom, a report from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), published in March 2021, predicted that 60% of hospitalisations and 70% of deaths would be among people who had received two doses of the vaccine, despite the latter remaining highly effective. David Gorski wrote on Science-Based Medicine that Wodarg and Yeadon were "stoking real fear [...] based on speculative nonsense".False claims that a vaccinated person could "shed" SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, allegedly causing menstrual irregularities or other harmful effects on the reproductive health of non-vaccinated women who are in proximity to them, such as miscarriage, were cited by the Centner Academy, a private school in Miami, which announced it would not employ teachers who received the COVID-19 vaccine. A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. Medical mistrust is also seen in Russia where one person described a lack of understanding what the vaccine is and claimed that if there was more statistics and research about the Sputnik V and other Russian made vaccines they would be more "loyal". They do this partly to counteract vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories. Whether reporting of these deaths actually encourages opponents of vaccination to change their position is unclear, but it has been asserted that proponents of vaccination "have expressed thanks for providing a record of anti-vaccine deaths that have helped them convince skeptics to get the shots". 
  Mental health is more complicated. It’s not either or. Don’t forget Covid itself will cause mental health issues in many suffering  irreversible organ damage, chronic pain and other long term neurological symptoms, plus grief from lost loved ones, trauma to nhs staff etc. [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Mental health symptoms in the general population and among health care providers
According to mental health experts, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused negative effects on people's mental health around the globe. Children and families also had psychological effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people across the globe. Anxiety and depression
An increase of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic is a commonly held perception worldwide. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has affected rates of mental health amongst most western cultures, the people within these demographics are likely to be impacted by historical, social and biological factors that have led to high levels of depression and anxiety irrespective of COVID-19. Together, these findings suggest that COVID-19 may increase psychiatric sequelae, and those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions may be at increased risk for COVID-19. Those admitted to the ICU while battling their direct infection of the COVID-19 virus experience mental health consequences as a result of this stay, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. 
Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/CeJM6NoGhQ [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. About 35% of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 experience neurological complications. Neurological symptoms are not unique to COVID-19; infection with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also give rise to acute and delayed neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural function, leading to illness and complications, many of which frequently are neurological in nature, such as impaired motor skills and altered behavior. 
  And to be clear I'm NOT trying to say that *only* the vaccine could cause an ADE issue in the future. Antibodies from surviving Covid-19 could potentially trigger the same problem. But what is impossible to know at this point is if the vaccine boosted antibody response could [SEP] Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), sometimes less precisely called immune enhancement or disease enhancement, is a phenomenon in which binding of a virus to suboptimal antibodies enhances its entry into host cells, followed by its replication. ADE may cause enhanced respiratory disease, but is not limited to respiratory disease. ADE can occur during the development of a primary or secondary viral infection, as well as with a virus challenge after vaccination. ADE is mainly mediated by IgG antibodies, but IgM and IgA antibodies have also been shown to trigger it. Coronavirus
COVID-19
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ADE was observed in animal studies of laboratory rodents with vaccines for SARS-CoV, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to the more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune-compromised organs.ADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken sub-neutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. However, instead of preventing infection of the host cell, this process can facilitate viral infection of immune cells, causing ADE. See also

Don't touch your face😱! We've all heard it can promote the spread of #covid . It's always a good idea, though. Touching your face introduces bacteria & irritants to your face that can exacerbate or cause acne & contact dermatitis. #udc #skinfacts #skincare #face #donttouch https://t.co/0UQYLIYky2 [SEP] Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Epidemiology
Contact dermatitis constitutes 95% of all occupational skin disorders. Signs and symptoms
Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Much of the allergic contact dermatitis that arises is caused by occupational exposure. When personal protective equipment is tightly worn on the face for extended periods of time, it can lead to the formation of erythema, blisters and ulcers. Repeated hand washing and contact with irritant sanitising agents can result in contact dermatitis. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends to keep the facial skin clean and moisturised to avoid having skin diseases. Many other chemical compounds can also cause contact dermatitis. 
The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccines works by effectively revving up the immune system to fight off the virus that causes the disease. But what if that same approach could be used to turn the immune system down to treat autoimmune disorders? https://t.co/YK3Rxfzed5 [NEWLINE]#mRNA [SEP] A therapeutic vaccine works by activating the immune system of a patient to fight an infection. Such vaccines would enhance affected patients immune systems to fight the disease. Immunotherapy or biological therapy is the treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system. Vaccine-induced immunity to COVID-19 relies mostly on an immunomodulatory T-cell response.Therapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons, imiquimod and cellular membrane fractions from bacteria are licensed for medical use. Suppression immunotherapies
Immune suppression dampens an abnormal immune response in autoimmune diseases or reduces a normal immune response to prevent rejection of transplanted organs or cells. It has been observed in a preclinical trial that regulation of the immune system by small immunosuppressive molecules such as Vitamin D, Dexamethasone, and Curcumin administered under a low-dose regimen and subcutaneously, could be helpful in preventing or treating chronic inflammation. Viral immunotherapy
Viral immunotherapy is the use of virus to stimulate the body's immune system. Unlike traditional vaccines, in which attenuated or killed virus/bacteria is used to generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses to present a specific antigen to the immune system. 
 I have APS, the syndrome which develops with both vaccine and covid to cause clots, had AZ with no ill effects but I'm anticoagulated. Those who aren't and then have other risk factors like OCP could be the ones developing these complications. It's just a blood test, easily done. [SEP] Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded.

This happens because many vaccines encourage the body to produce antibodies against a particular disease, and blood tests often determine whether a person has those antibodies, regardless of whether they came from the infection or just a vaccination. Indications for testing
The main indication for testing for lupus anticoagulant is a suspected antiphospholipid syndrome, whose main manifestations are blood clots (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia.In a suspected antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant is generally tested in conjunction with anti-apolipoprotein antibodies and anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and diagnostic criteria require one clinical event (i.e.

    Not to mention the lasting damage covid has on a person, we’re still finding out that covid can cause life changing issues, fibrosis, COPD, Diabetes, CKD, brain tissue death, to name a few these are in relatively Healthy people [SEP] Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. In people age 0–18 years the prevalence of long COVID conditions – like mood symptoms, CFS and sleep disorders – appears to be at ~25% overall.In a large population cohort study in Scotland, 42% of respondents said they had not fully recovered after 6 to 18 months after catching COVID, and 6% indicated they had not recovered at all. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. Post-COVID conditions are not one illness, but rather may involve numerous organ systems and disorders. See also

[SEP] Malaria vaccines are vaccines that prevent malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease which annually affects an estimated 247 million people worldwide and causes 619,000 deaths. It is the first vaccine that meets the World Health Organization's goal of a malaria vaccine with at least 75% efficacy. A phase III trial with 4,800 children across four African countries was reported in November 2022, demonstrating vaccine efficacy of 74% against a severe malaria episode. Malaria Vaccine Initiative

Gates Foundation Global Health: Malaria As of 2020, there is one vaccine which has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa. Efforts at decreasing the disease in Africa since 2000 have been partially effective, with rates of the disease dropping by an estimated forty percent on the continent.Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.In total, malaria may have killed 50-60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization's Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy. 
  No but keep in mind they also believe the world is flat and that 5G causes covid and vaccines cause infertility & autism 😒 [SEP] Anti-vaccination activists and other people in many countries have spread a variety of unfounded conspiracy theories and other misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines based on misunderstood or misrepresented science, religion, and law. These have included exaggerated claims about side effects, misrepresentations about how the immune system works and when and how COVID-19 vaccines are made, a story about COVID-19 being spread by 5G, and other false or distorted information. Misinformation
Various false theories have spread in different parts of the world regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. This claim was based on a misrepresentation of a 2018 study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), which did not involve the mRNA used in vaccines. Called by Republicans as an expert witness before a June 2021 hearing of the Ohio House Health Committee, anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny promoted the false claim, adding, "There's been people who have long suspected that there's been some sort of an interface, yet to be defined interface, between what's being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers.

Financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur David Martin claimed that mRNA vaccines do not fit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definitions of a vaccine because they do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. While research has been ongoing to evaluate the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV 2 transmission, neither the CDC nor the FDA stipulate that vaccines must stop transmission of a virus, both stating that a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to produce immunity to an infectious agent. Vaccines as an "operating system"
Beginning in 2021, misinformation started circulating on the Internet claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines are actually "operating systems". No COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. or Europe contain magnetic or metal ingredients or microchips. Arguments against vaccination are contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.Founder Brandy Vaughan died in December 2020; no replacement executive director has been named. The message used on the billboards claimed vaccines kill children, portraying specific cases even though there was no evidence supporting the claims. Although a small fraction of vaccine doses provoke serious adverse reactions, health professionals agree the benefits of being protected against a wide range of infectious diseases far outweigh the risks. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects".

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The South African health department also indicated that the variant may be driving the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country due to the variant spreading at a more rapid pace than other earlier variants of the virus.Scientists noted that the variant contains several mutations that allow it to attach more easily to human cells because of the following three mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike glycoprotein of the virus: N501Y, K417N, and E484K. 
 The worldwide Covid vaccine program is actually a gain-of-function exercise.  Geert Vanden Bossche and Bret Weinstein April 23 2021 https://t.co/Z3VDVJMChC  Ep 79.1: Viruses are messages; Can be hacked to control life and cause disease. https://t.co/TNKUUvJURZ [SEP] Introducing a mutation that would allow influenza B to infect rabbits in a controlled laboratory situation would be considered a gain-of-function experiment, as the virus did not previously have that function. That type of experiment could then help reveal which parts of the virus's genome correspond to the species that it can infect, enabling the creation of antiviral medicines which block this function.In virology, gain-of-function research is usually employed with the intention of better understanding current and future pandemics. In vaccine development, gain-of-function research is conducted in the hope of gaining a head start on a virus and being able to develop a vaccine or therapeutic before it emerges. The term "gain of function" is sometimes applied more narrowly to refer to "research which could enable a pandemic-potential pathogen to replicate more quickly or cause more harm in humans or other closely-related mammals. Experiments that have been referred to as "gain-of-function"
In early 2011, two groups were investigating how flu viruses specific to birds could possibly cross over and create pandemics in humans: one led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison, Wisconsin and another led by Ron Fouchier at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. United States
Gain-of-function research moratorium
From 2014 to 2017, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Health and Human Services instituted a gain-of-function research moratorium and funding pause on any dual-use research into specific pandemic-potential pathogens (influenza, MERS, and SARS) while the regulatory environment and review process were reconsidered and overhauled. On 19 December 2017, the NIH lifted the moratorium because gain-of-function research was deemed "important in helping us identify, understand, and develop strategies and effective countermeasures against rapidly evolving pathogens that pose a threat to public health."

   It is very rare in the context of the vaccine and myocarditis in general. Vaccines cause side effects, they wouldn’t work otherwise. It’s simply just a reaction to your body making antibodies and C-Reactive Protein. And compared to actually getting covid, it’s not that bad. [SEP] Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. However, the specific syndrome - of embolic and thrombotic events in combination with low levels of blood platelets - presenting in post-vaccination cases raised the possibility of an association between the vaccine and the relatively rare syndrome. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". Risk of diseases
Bell's palsy
In late 2020, claims circulated on social media that the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine caused Bell's palsy in trial participants. Blood clots
Videos posted to Facebook and Instagram have claimed without evidence that 62 percent of people given an mRNA vaccine develop blood clots, and that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine causes blood to clot "in a minute or two". Studies have found possible causal links between the AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines and a rare clotting disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), but the risk is low for most people, with 47 confirmed reports of the condition out of more than 15 million recipients of the Janssen vaccine in the United States as of October 2021. A study published in JAMA showed an increased risk for myocarditis within seven days of vaccination. 
Interesting study. Please take your vaccine when offered it. The sooner you do, the faster we are out of these restrictions 🙏 x  Covid eight times more likely to cause rare brain clot than AstraZeneca vaccine, study finds https://t.co/mm5W9s4HJH [SEP] The advice is "based on the increasing risk of severe outcomes from COVID‑19 in older adults (and hence a higher benefit from vaccination) and a potentially increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following AstraZeneca vaccination in those under 50 years." For example, by the end of March Germany reported 31 cases of very rare Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, primarily in under 55s, after 2.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered, and a case fatality for this condition of up to 40%, causing Canada to suspend the use of this vaccine as well. The company, UK regulators and the European Medicines Agency stated that the vaccine was safe and there was no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots among recipients. In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Then, on 15 April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommended to the government to permanently suspended vaccination with AstraZeneca due to the "rare but severe incidents with low platelet counts, blood clots, and haemorrhages," since in the case of Norway, "the risk of dying after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine would be higher than the risk of dying from the disease, particularly for younger people." The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can still be used in people aged under 60 years where the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks for that person, and the person has made an informed decision based on an understanding of the risks and benefits in consultation with a medical professional. AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found. The EMA noted that COVID-19 itself causes an increased risk of the development of blood clots, and as such the vaccine would lower the risk of the formation of blood clots even if the 15 cases' causal link were to be confirmed. 
   Dying isn't the only effect. COVID is a vascular disease and has been shown to cause permanent brain damage. So it looks like we'll be supporting a large class of brain damaged conservatives. [SEP] Ultimately, brain function depreciates rapidly resulting in death.Many patients who undergo the chronic form claim never to have had an acute attack. Such damage leads to varying levels of cognitive decline. A rapidly deteriorating condition may lead to death from a stroke, heart disease, or infection.The disease is described as both a mental and behavioural disorder within the ICD-11. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
    covid vaccine doesn't cause fertility issues, or any of the things you mentioned  https://t.co/unEXqNzugT [SEP] Immunological approaches
Vaccines can stimulate the body's immune system to produce antibodies to key proteins involved in reproduction, inhibiting these proteins’ functions. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. Reproductive health
In a December 2020 petition to the European Medicines Agency, German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and British researcher Michael Yeadon suggested, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines could cause infertility in women by targeting the syncytin-1 protein necessary for placenta formation. A study in Andrologia found that Google searches relating to a supposed link between vaccination against COVID-19 and adverse effects on fertility increased following the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID vaccines in the United States, indicating that concerns about alleged impacts on fertility are a major contributor to vaccine hesitancy. A study conducted on 44 rats injected with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at doses over 300 times the human dose by body weight and 44 rats injected with placebo found no statistically significant evidence of any adverse effects on the fertility of female rats or on the health of the offspring of rats (the 3% lower pregnancy rate found in the vaccine group was not statistically significant). Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States "can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy". 
    I never said Covid-19 wasn’t a real coronavirus.  And deaths linked to Covid-19 are primarily caused directly from pneumonia, or flu-like symptoms.  The classifications for influenza and pneumonia reporting changed when Covid-19 appeared.  Facts. [SEP] During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease and virus were sometimes called "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus", or "Wuhan pneumonia".In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively named it "2019-nCoV", short for "2019 Novel Coronavirus", or "2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease". Use of "the Coronavirus" to refer to the COVID-19 pandemic which began in December 2019 has also been accepted. The Oxford English Dictionary noted that "the" is typically not used when referring to the disease, COVID-19, but is not uncommon when referring to the virus.Reference to the virus and/or the disease as "corona", "the corona", and "the rona" has also arisen in various parts of the world. Identification as influenza
The 1557 pandemic's nature as a worldwide, highly-contagious respiratory disease with fast onset of flu-like symptoms has led many physicians, from medical historians like Charles Creighton to modern epidemiologists, to consider the causative disease as influenza. Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. COVID-19 pandemic deaths. This strain caused COVID-19, which caused the COVID-19 pandemic. See also

COVID vaccine is likely to cause infertility issues through an autoimmune disorder that affects placenta development. What a wonderful coincidence that vaccines tend to cause autoimmune disorders, even a new experimental one. Btw, autism is being found to be an autoimmune issue. https://t.co/7hzF1xKybH [SEP] Women with autoimmune diseases can safely have children. During pregnancy
Concerns about fertility and pregnancy are present in women with autoimmune diseases. Fertility treatments are able to help some women with autoimmune disease become pregnant.Changes in the severity of the disease seem to vary depending on the type of disease. For this reason, it may be extremely helpful for women with autoimmune diseases to seek treatment when conceiving. Its author was found to be on the payroll of litigants against vaccine manufacturers.The idea of a link between vaccines and autism was extensively investigated and shown to be false. The scientific consensus is that there is no relationship, causal or otherwise, between vaccines and incidence of autism, and vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.Nevertheless, the anti-vaccination movement continues to promote myths, conspiracy theories and misinformation linking the two. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. References

  All of these people are missing the long term unknown risks of covid infection. Epstein Barr Virus is a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, hep B & C cause liver cancer. 15% of cancers are viral! And people don’t want to risk vaccines???? [SEP] Viral infections are risk factors for cervical cancer, 80% of liver cancers, and 15–20% of the other cancers. Viruses
Viruses are one of the most important risk factors for cancer development in humans.Infection by some hepatitis viruses, especially hepatitis B and hepatitis C, can induce a long-term viral infection that leads to liver cancer in about 1 in 200 of people infected with hepatitis B each year (more in Asia, fewer in North America), and in about 1 in 45 of people infected with hepatitis C each year. Vaccinating a large portion of the population may also benefit the unvaccinated.HPV vaccines are very safe. Contraindications
While the use of HPV vaccines can help reduce cervical cancer deaths by two-thirds around the world, not everyone is eligible for vaccination. Verification that cervical cancer is caused by an infectious agent led several other groups to develop vaccines against HPV strains that cause most cases of cervical cancer. Barriers include the limited understanding by many people that HPV causes cervical cancer, the difficulty of getting pre-teens and teens into the doctor's office to get a shot, and the high cost of the vaccine ($120/dose, $360 total for the three required doses, plus the cost of doctor visits). Thousands of Americans die each year from cancers preventable by the vaccine. This is because vaccination before infection decreases the risk of a number of forms of cancer.There has been some controversy around the HPV vaccine's rollout and distribution. 
 Sorry[NEWLINE]Dexamethasone can cause blood clots, will help #COVID19 [NEWLINE]Try Tadalfil instead, it helps lungs, reduces inflammation and clotting[NEWLINE]Forget purpose of medicine, we need results [SEP] Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, superior vena cava syndrome (a complication of some forms of cancer), and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. Medical uses
Anti-inflammatory
Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. COVID-19
Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for people with COVID-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation).The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for people with severe COVID-19, defined as people with SpO2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although dexamethasone, and other glucocorticoids, reduce mortality in COVID-19 they have also been associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, secondary infections being a significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients.The mechanism of action of dexamethasone involves suppression of late-stage interferon type I programs in severe COVID-19 patients. High-altitude illnesses
Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It was introduced for medical use in 1958.On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. The final report was published in February 2021.The World Health Organization (WHO) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving COVID-19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the WHO Director-General stated that "WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started reviewing results from the RECOVERY study arm that involved the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital to provide an opinion on the results and in particular the potential use of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with COVID-19. 
  The viruses that cause flu are not the same species as COVID-19, please do not mix them up. Also, HPV does not cause flu, but its long term infection does lead to cancer. What NPR is saying is that long term COVID-19 infection may also lead to serious damage. [SEP] Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection) is caused by a DNA virus from the Papillomaviridae family. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV and two strains – HPV16 and HPV18 – account for 70% of cases. HPV type 16 is the strain most likely to cause cancer and is present in about 47% of all cervical cancers, and in many vaginal and vulvar cancers, penile cancers, anal cancers, and cancers of the head and neck.The table below lists common symptoms of HPV infection and the associated types of HPV. Co-factors such as cigarette smoke can also enhance the risk of such HPV-related cancers.HPV is believed to cause cancer by integrating its genome into nuclear DNA. Cervical cancer
Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are associated with HPV infection, with two types, HPV16 and HPV18, present in 70% of cases. Persistent HPV infection increases the risk for developing cervical carcinoma. Individuals who have an increased incidence of these types of infection are women with HIV/AIDS, who are at a 22-fold increased risk of cervical cancer.The carcinogenic HPV types in cervical cancer belong to the alphapapillomavirus genus and can be grouped further into HPV clades. Because the process of transforming normal cervical cells into cancerous ones is slow, cancer occurs in people having been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade or more (persistent infection). 
If someone tells you the vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage. [SEP] COVID-19 infection in pregnancy is associated with several pregnancy complications. However vaccination against COVID-19 was not associated with an increase in miscarriage or reduction in live birth. Reproductive health
In a December 2020 petition to the European Medicines Agency, German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and British researcher Michael Yeadon suggested, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines could cause infertility in women by targeting the syncytin-1 protein necessary for placenta formation. A study conducted on 44 rats injected with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at doses over 300 times the human dose by body weight and 44 rats injected with placebo found no statistically significant evidence of any adverse effects on the fertility of female rats or on the health of the offspring of rats (the 3% lower pregnancy rate found in the vaccine group was not statistically significant). The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contained tissue from aborted fetuses. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. 
 3) Plus the death rate isn't the full story.  COVID-18 causes vascular damage.  This can result in secondary strokes, loss or reduction of various senses, cardiac problems, and one or more of those conditions which "immuno-compromise" one. [SEP] The symptoms of COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness. Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. Other
cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart inflammation. They are common traits in severe COVID-19 patients due to the relation with the respiratory system.Hypertension seems to be the most prevalent risk factor for myocardial injury in COVID-19 disease. It was reported in 58% of individuals with cardiac injury in a recent meta-analysis.Several cases of acute myocarditis associated with COVID-19 have been described around the globe and are diagnosed in multiple ways. Blood clots and bleeding
Patients are at increased risk of a range of different blood clots, some potentially fatal, for months following COVID infection. Although the risks were highest in patients with more severe illness, even those with mild Covid had a threefold increased risk of DVT and a sevenfold increased risk of pulmonary embolism. Symptoms
Long COVID can attack a multitude of organs such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain. 
  The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA. Classen says mRNA vaccines may cause Alzheimer's, ALS, and Prion disease. He provides no evidence for these claims. He doesn't provide proof because there is none. [SEP] An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for infectious agents such as influenza, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.In March 2022 Moderna announced the development of mRNA vaccines for 15 diseases: Chikungunya virus, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Dengue, Ebola virus disease, HIV, Malaria, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome, Tuberculosis and Zika. Another biological advantage of mRNA vaccines is that since the antigens are produced inside the cell, they stimulate cellular immunity, as well as humoral immunity.mRNA vaccines have the production advantage that they can be designed swiftly. The mRNA strands in the vaccine may elicit an unintended immune reaction – this entails the body believing itself to be sick, and the person feeling as if they are as a result. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue.

Spike protein cytotoxicity
In 2021, anti-vaccination misinformation circulated on social media saying that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were "very dangerous" and "cytotoxic". Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. In a situation with herd immunity to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.The non-specific effects should not be confused with the side effects of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases anaphylaxis). FALSE: Vaccines cause harmful side effects and even death: Vaccines are very safe. Most adverse events after vaccination are mild and temporary, such as a sore throat or mild fever, which can be controlled by taking paracetamol after vaccination. See also

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Plague bacteria secrete several toxins, one of which is known to cause beta-adrenergic blockade.Y. In cases of surgical mask shortages, patient overcrowding, poor ventilation in hospital wards, or other crisis situations, pre-exposure prophylaxis might be warranted if sufficient supplies of antimicrobials are available.Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for people who had close (<6 feet), sustained contact with a patient with pneumonic plague and were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment. Biological weapon
The plague has a long history as a biological weapon. "Antimicrobial Treatment and Prophylaxis of Plague: Recommendations for Naturally Acquired Infections and Bioterrorism Response" (PDF). Wearing a close-fitting surgical mask also protects against infection.The mortality rate from untreated pneumonic plague approaches 100%. The outbreak was feared to be much worse because the plague superficially resembles other common diseases such as influenza and bronchitis; over 200 people that had been quarantined were released when they did not test positive for the plague. 
Quick lesson about autoimmune diseases and COVID-19. Auto-Immune disease causes the white blood cells that normally protect your body from invaders to turn around and attack your cells, tissues and organs. Chronic… https://t.co/551UkCqIH3 [SEP] An autoimmune disease is a condition arising from an abnormal immune response to a functioning body part. Analysis of large cohort data shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) is linked to a substantially increased risk of developing a diverse new-onset autoimmune diseases. In autoimmunity, the patient's immune system is activated against the body's own proteins. Autoimmune heart diseases are the effects of the body's own immune defense system mistaking cardiac antigens as foreign and attacking them leading to inflammation of the heart as a whole, or in parts. In immunology, autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells, tissues and other normal body constituents. Any disease resulting from this type of immune response is termed an "autoimmune disease". Managing inflammation is critical in autoimmune diseases. White blood cells, also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. 
 Actually wearing masks causes bacterial pneumonia which people can die from NOT covid19. Most people do not know how to don/doff PPE properly. Follow the science Big Guy! [SEP] During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks or coverings, including N95, FFP2, surgical, and cloth masks, have been employed as public and personal health control measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. Scientists now recommend having a triple-layered surgical mask and a respirator.According to #Masks4All, in September 2020, approximately 95% of the world population lived in a country where the government and leading disease experts recommend or require the use of masks in public places to limit the spread of COVID-19. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. In August 2020, the CDC added that exhalation valves or vents in masks do not help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others.In a November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC reiterated their recommendation for the community use of masks and specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They concluded that the benefit of masking for SARS-CoV-2 control is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection, which is likely complementary and possibly synergistic so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use.The CDC said healthcare personnel should wear a NIOSH-approved N95 (or equivalent or higher-level) respirator or a face mask (if a respirator is not available) with a face shield or goggles as part of their personal protective equipment, while patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a face mask or cloth face covering during transport. In December 2021, a study in PNAS found that when two people wear surgical masks, while the infectious is speaking, the risk of infection remains below 30% after one hour, but when both wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, it is 0.4%.In February 2022, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that surgical masks worn at indoor public venues can reduce the chances of testing positive for COVID-19 by 66%, while tightfitting N95 and KN95 masks can reduce the odds of infection by 83%.

This Serology (blood) test, can verify the different types of antibodies developed after being exposed  to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is also known as Antibody Test.  [NEWLINE]#coronavirus #covid #corona #staysafe #socialdistancing#pandemic #virus https://t.co/efc4wI6LUR [SEP] COVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. The two main types of tests detect either the presence of the virus or antibodies produced in response to infection. Tests that look for the viral antigens (parts of the virus) are called antigen tests. Antigen tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal, nasal swab, or saliva specimens.Antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2 offer a faster and less expensive method to test for the virus. Antibody tests
The body responds to a viral infection by producing antibodies that help neutralize the virus. Blood tests (also called serology tests or serology immunoassays) can detect the presence of such antibodies. COVID-19 testing in the United States can identify whether a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. November
On 6 November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the first serology test that detects neutralizing antibodies from recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are antibodies that bind to a specific part of a pathogen and have been observed in a laboratory setting to decrease SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of cells. 
If the virus causes blood clots & if the vaxx can cause blood clots in some, wouldn't indiscriminate vaxx in the recently infected cause an even higher risk of clots?      think anyone at   cares?  https://t.co/FicR4O63qG [SEP] Post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), or vaccine-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VATT), are rare types of blood clotting syndromes that were initially observed in a number of people who had previously received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine (AZD1222) during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Causes
The rare simultaneous occurrence of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) with blood clots after vaccination raised the original concern about this condition. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine.

Australia's vaccine roll-out setbacks take shine off its Covid-19 success: April 16, 2021 10:00 AMHeavy reliance on the AstraZeneca shot, which may cause blood clots, and lack of information on supply have drawn… https://t.co/HvcYwmnH1Q #guestpost #lastminutenews #guestposting https://t.co/OpkJh3dxM8 [SEP] COVID-19 vaccine national rollout phases
On 21 February 2021, a day before the previously announced program start date, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, Chief Nurse Alison McMillan, Kris Matthews and "a small group" of aged care staff and residents became the first Australians to receive the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine. Vaccine supply & issues
Vaccination timeline criticisms
On 11 March 2021, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) attested that it was implausible that the government's target of offering vaccination to every Australian by October 2021 would be achieved, and suggested that mid-December 2021 would be a more realistic date. The federal government said that the European Union (EU) blocking the shipment of more than 3 million doses of vaccine to Australia was a major reason for the delayed vaccine rollout, although the EU only officially confirmed blocking the export of 250,000 doses in early March.Medical advice discouraging the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on people under the age of 50 due to incidents of vaccine-related blood clotting was a further major setback in the vaccination rollout, given the AstraZeneca vaccine was originally slated as the cornerstone of the entire program. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. Although no causal link with vaccination has been shown, several other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia also halted the vaccine rollout over the following days while waiting for the EMA to finish a safety review triggered by the cases.In April 2021, the EMA concluded its safety review and concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects while reaffirming the overall benefits of the vaccine. As of 20 April 2021 there had been three confirmed cases of blood clotting tied to the vaccine in Canada, out of over 700,000 doses administered in the country.Beginning 18 April, amid a major third wave of the virus, several Canadian provinces announced that they would backtrack on the NACI recommendation and extend eligibility for the AstraZeneca vaccine to residents as young as 40 years old, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found. April global restrictions and legal dispute
On 7 April, following further review of the data, the EMA concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine. 
 The immune response to COVID can kill (see cytokine storm and note that both the virus and the vaccine can cause clotting) so why are we deliberately creating immune responses with vaccinations? The vaccine is just another way that people can initiate the deadly immune response [SEP] Trends
Since at least 2013, scientists have been trying to develop synthetic third-generation vaccines by reconstructing the outside structure of a virus; it was hoped that this will help prevent vaccine resistance.Principles that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". A therapeutic vaccine fights an existing infection in the body rather than immunizing the body for protection against future diseases and infections. Patients affected with chronic viral infections are administered with therapeutic vaccines, as their immune system is not able to produce enough efficient antibodies.Provenge, developed by Dendreon, was the first therapeutic vaccine approved by the FDA in 2010. This type of vaccine can be employed for the treatment of various type of diseases and viral infections. Efforts are being made to develop vaccines against various fatal diseases such as HIV, cancer, dengue fever, cholera, Diphtheria, etc. Such vaccines would enhance affected patients immune systems to fight the disease. Therapeutic vaccine against cancer
Cancer is the major cause of deaths in the recent era. 
Cytokine storms occur when the body’s immune system attacks itself, and has been noted as a leading cause of death in patients suffering infected with #Covid-19.  https://t.co/pfmd08gNtA [SEP] A cytokine storm, also called hypercytokinemia, is a physiological reaction in humans and other animals in which the innate immune system causes an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines. Normally, cytokines are part of the body's immune response to infection, but their sudden release in large quantities can cause multisystem organ failure and death.Cytokine storms can be caused by a number of infectious and non-infectious etiologies, especially viral respiratory infections such as H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well. Relationship to COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors have attributed many deaths to cytokine storms. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. A cytokine plasma level analysis showed that in cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the levels of many interleukins and cytokines are highly elevated, indicating evidence of a cytokine storm. It refers to cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) and occurs when large numbers of white blood cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate yet more white blood cells. Immediate-onset CRS is a cytokine storm, although severe cases of CRS have also been called cytokine storms. 
How the vaccine works: The Pfizer/BioTech COVID-19 vaccine contains the Messenger RNA which is packaged in a lipid envelop that allows the messenger RNA to enter the cells. This will cause the cells to produce the COVID-19 cell protein. When the protein is released from the cells [SEP] The vaccine delivers molecules of antigen-encoding mRNA into immune cells, which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen (such as a virus) or by a cancer cell. The mRNA is delivered by a co-formulation of the RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells. "Understanding mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines". Medical uses
The Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is used to provide protection against COVID-19, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, by eliciting an immune response to the S antigen. The vaccine is used to reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.The vaccine is supplied in a multidose vial as "a white to off-white, sterile, preservative-free, frozen suspension for intramuscular injection". The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured by Moderna since 2020, is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike(S)-2P antigen of SARS-CoV-2 with a transmembrane anchor. A viral vector vaccine is a vaccine that uses a viral vector to deliver genetic material (DNA) that can be transcribed by the recipient's host cells as mRNA coding for a desired protein, or antigen, to elicit an immune response. These vaccines use a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to carry instructions for proteins to produce an immune response. 
Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the USA, more Americans are dying with Covid-19 than Ischemic heart disease, Lung cancer, or COPD! We need Herd immunity from 70-80% of the population vaccinated! [SEP] In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic ranks first on the list of disasters in the United States by death toll; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history. In the most recent pandemic prior to COVID-19, the 2009 swine flu pandemic took the lives of more than 12,000 Americans and hospitalized another 270,000 over the course of approximately a year.According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the "most prepared" nation in 2020.

In some cases, long Covid could mean lifelong Covid = lung damage, heart damage and brain damage that can cause memory loss and brain fog, kidney damage, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, loss of taste and smell, anxiety, depression and, above all, fatigue. https://t.co/cZfcObJGOA [SEP] Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. The most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue and memory problems. Many other symptoms have also been reported, including malaise, headaches, shortness of breath, anosmia (loss of smell), parosmia (distorted smell), ageusia (distortion or loss of taste), muscle weakness, low-grade fever, and cognitive dysfunction.Estimates of the prevalence of long COVID vary based on definition, population studied, time period studied, and methodology, generally ranging between 5% and 50%. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms
Long COVID symptoms may involve multiple organs and may be severe. Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.Symptoms reported by adults with long COVID include:
Fatigue, including extreme fatigue
Substantial exercise intolerance more than three months after infection; post-exertional malaise similar to that which is the hallmark of chronic fatigue syndrome
Dysautonomia / Orthostatic Intolerance / Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
Long-lasting cough
Muscle weakness and/or pain

It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. Symptoms
Long COVID can attack a multitude of organs such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain. 
  Covid just became the 6th leading cause of death in ohio. Is there a reason we aren't trying to stop Heart disease? [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of Ohio on March 9, 2020, when the state's first cases were reported. In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic ranks first on the list of disasters in the United States by death toll; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. In the United States, cardiovascular diseases account for one out of four deaths. These trends are occurring despite improvements in the medical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including workplace health promotion, is key to reducing death rates. The 7th International Conference on Work Environment and Cardiovascular Diseases emphasized the need to bridge the gap between knowledge and preventive interventions at the workplace, to reduce cardiovascular diseases, through effective collaboration between health operators involved in prevention of CVD.

Researchers believe that the inflammation may lead to heart failure.- German Study[NEWLINE]COVID-19 may increase the risk of blood clots, which may cause heart damage or heart attacks in some people. [SEP] This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls. Increased levels of inflammation may lead to higher risk of clotting as well as an increased risk of stent/device subsequent thrombosis. : e279 : Table 5  In addition, viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. If more than one cause is present, progression is more likely and prognosis is worse.Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab and substance use disorders of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest.Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs).

frequently asked questions about HIV vaccine VISP This vaccine does not grow or reproduce in the human body, making it fit for stem cell transplant and CAR T patients. In other words, if person “A” has been vaccinated for virus X and person “B” has not, person “B” can receive immunity to virus X just by coming into contact with person “A”. Summary
The book's introduction states: "I hope that anyone reading this book will read it and gain an understanding why vaccines are so vitally important to the health and well being of all of us." Another positive review came from Booklist, where Karen Springen wrote that "This thoroughly researched book should convince even ardent vaccine skeptics that the benefits of giving kids shots to prevent illnesses far outweigh any negatives," and David Gorski wrote that the book was "essential reading for all new parents with any doubts at all about vaccines." 
  Are you aware that the vaccines could cause miscarriage? The real data regarding covid is that there are tiny numbers, percentage wise, of generally healthy people under the age of 60 that die from COVID or that get admitted into ICU. Are you worried about cancer too? https://t.co/gFOUxRcWTW [SEP] Cancer
The website Natural News has published claims that mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 can cause cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressing proteins. The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Vaccines as a cause of death
United States
Claims have been made that data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveals a hidden toll of COVID-19 vaccine related deaths. Aaron's death was reported as being due to natural causes, and medical officials did not believe the COVID-19 vaccine had any adverse effect on his health.In October 7, 2022, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued a press release discouraging men aged 18 to 39 from taking the COVID-19 vaccine since a study by the Florida Department of Health concluded vaccinated men of the age group had an 84% increased likelihood of dying from heart problems. We've lost so many people to COVID. A PNAS report in September 2020 confirmed that the virus is much more dangerous for the elderly than the young, noting that about 70% of all U.S. COVID-19 deaths had occurred to those over the age of 70.As of early August 2020, among the 45 countries that had over 50,000 cases, the U.S. had the eighth highest number of deaths per-capita. The unintended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a threat to the health of pregnant women. According to Carleigh Krubine, with the pandemic, the lack of data may cause many to hesitate to use highly beneficial and ultimately safe vaccines leading them to vaccination, which will protect and promote both, maternal and neonatal health.Different countries are taking different approaches to the vaccination of pregnant women. 
 I think systemically injecting spike protein causes an exaggerated immune response that is identical 2systemic COVID infection in frail elderly. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The immune response does the damage only this time because it’s injected systemically bypassing the innate system we see ICU & death. [SEP] When activated, this system can go on to elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and sometimes cell death. Inflammaging and COVID-19
Adaptive immunity, involving the ability to fight off pathogens, declines with age. Chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, which both increase with advanced chronological age, renders the elderly population more vulnerable to adverse, long term effects of viral infection by SARS-CoV2. Inflammaging alone contributes to pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion that, in combination with viral infection by SARS-CoV2, may exhaust immune system function, contributing to worse outcomes when fighting COVID-19. Available evidence indicates that SARS-CoV2 enters the central nervous system through the lymphatic system and the virus was confirmed present in the capillaries and neuronal cells of the frontal lobe of COVID-19 patients. Viral infection is capable of inducing neuroinflammation through neuro-immune interactions. While aging is the most significant risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic, low-grade inflammation and immunosenescence may be aggravated by a viral infection, worsening the aging phenotype and contributing to the development of neurodegenerative disease. Infection by the H1N1 virus was shown to contribute to Parkinson's disease development.Inflammaging and COVID-19 infection may lead to worse outcomes and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease in aged individuals. 
 in addition to that,  covid is viral in nature — no antibiotic can ever kill viral pathogens.  antibiotics are used if there is a bacterial cause and not viral cause.  i hope i made that clear. [SEP] An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza; drugs which inhibit growth of viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics. Sometimes, the term antibiotic—literally "opposing life", from the Greek roots ἀντι anti, "against" and βίος bios, "life"—is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas non-antibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. "Antibacterials" include antiseptic drugs, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants, whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed. In current usage, the term "antibiotic" is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not.The term "antibiotic" derives from anti + βιωτικός (biōtikos), "fit for life, lively", which comes from βίωσις (biōsis), "way of life", and that from βίος (bios), "life". Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold. Whilst antibiotics can clearly be lifesaving in patients with bacterial infections, their overuse, especially in patients where infections are hard to diagnose, can lead to harm via multiple mechanisms. 
Certain diseases like CHF, COPD, and some viral illnesses like COVID-19 can cause an increased risk for hospital readmissions. Our signature wellness programs, like Just Breathe, can help your patients stay out of the hospital. #chf #copd #COVID19 #respiratorycare #healthcare https://t.co/a966Shb0wl [SEP] COPD Learn More Breathe Better, the title of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s national awareness and education campaign, has again been adopted as the theme for the most recent National COPD Awareness Month. Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high. COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5 million people (2.4% of the global population). People with COPD often have increased breathlessness and frequent colds before seeking treatment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for COPD exacerbations sharply decreased which may be attributable to reduction of emissions and cleaner air. Aclidinium, another long-acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life. Following a hospital admission pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to significantly reduce future hospital admissions, mortality and improve quality of life.The optimal exercise routine, use of noninvasive ventilation during exercise and intensity of exercise suggested for people with COPD, is unknown.

Both featured COVID-19's impact on the characters working at, and patients of, the hospital where the shows are set – including recurring characters becoming infected by the disease.The U.S. drama franchise One Chicago premiered on November 11, 2020, with Chicago Med featuring a COVID Unit in the hospital, where incoming patients were tested by paramedics in season 6.The U.S. procedural drama television series 9-1-1 began airing its season 4 in January 2021. The Great Challenge], an examination of how epidemics shape civilizations in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic inspired the 2020 romance novelette Kissing the Coronavirus. When former President Donald Trump issued COVID-19 a National Emergency in mid-March, both page views and order counts had a YoY increase to 96% and 88%, respectively. Coronavirus
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Guinea on 13 March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption to different combat sports, particularly during the years of 2020 into 2021. 
 COVID is also known to cause myocarditis, so it seems likely to me that this is caused by the spike protein, or an allergic reaction to the spike protein. Seems wrong to call it a side effect of the vaccine, per se. [SEP] "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The FDA and European Medicines Agency estimates the risk of myocarditis after the Covid-19 vaccine as 1 case per 100,000 of those who are vaccinated. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 vaccination was observed to be highest in males between 16–29 years of age, and after receiving the second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs). Myocarditis and COVID-19
Myocarditis can be seen during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; with the myocarditis being associated with a spectrum of severities from asymptomatic to fulminant. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 
                                                 Covid causes blood clots that cause heart attack, stroke, general organ damage and affect cognition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are also much more vulnerable to dying from this damage if your circulatory system is already compromised by diabetes, obesity etc. [SEP] A stroke may result in coma or death if it involves key areas of the brain.Other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease include migraines, seizures, epilepsy, or cognitive decline. Pregnancy-related conditions such as increased abdominal pressure and propensity for blood clots interacted negatively with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while viral damage to the placenta led to increased risk of dangerous conditions such as pre-eclampsia. Research demonstrates patients infected with influenza as well as Covid are over twice as likely to die as patients with only Covid. Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls. Increased levels of inflammation may lead to higher risk of clotting as well as an increased risk of stent/device subsequent thrombosis. This results in a low platelet count, low red blood cells due to their breakdown, and often kidney, heart, and brain dysfunction. These complications are also a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.The primary complications of diabetes due to damage in small blood vessels include damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. 
cause of cognitive injury could be seen if the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes covid-19, crosses the blood-brain barrier and directly attacks neural tissue [SEP] Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural function, leading to illness and complications, many of which frequently are neurological in nature, such as impaired motor skills and altered behavior. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Many patients with COVID-19 experience psychological symptoms that can arise either from the direct actions of the virus, the chronic increase in inflammation or secondary effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acutely by PCR, and is thought to enter via the olfactory system. Neurological symptoms are not unique to COVID-19; infection with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also give rise to acute and delayed neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Brain-scans and cognitive tests of 785 UK Biobank participants (401 positive cases) suggests COVID-19 is associated with, at least temporary, changes to the brain that include:
(greater) "reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus;"
"changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex;"
"reduction in global brain size"
as well as (greater) cognitive decline between the two time points of selected cognitive testsA study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 builds tunneling nanotubes from nose cells to gain access to the brain. 
Disappointing that  stewards are heavy handed with COVID 19 masking rules, hot weather increases asthma symptoms which could potentially cause health problems for some masked spectators. PA announcements need to take people with exemptions into account!  #ENGvNZ [SEP] Thunderstorm asthma (also referred to in the media as thunder fever or a pollen bomb) is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm. The criteria for, and exceptions to, face mask requirements have been ongoing issues during the COVID-19 pandemic,
during which some governments have mandated the wearing of masks. The tenor of mask refusal incidents may escalate into confrontations of verbal abuse, or in extreme cases might become violent. During the pandemic, $5 fines were imposed in San Francisco for failure to wear masks as a violation of "disturbing the peace", and many refusing to wear a mask paid the fines.Mask opposition has been a common sight around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic as those opposed to requirements to cover their faces have exhibited protests and unruly behavior in public over their refusal to follow this guideline. Following this guidance, President Biden signed an executive order in January 2021 requiring individuals to wear face masks on all federal property. Reasons
Reasons given by people who refuse to wear face masks range significantly, including: potential danger of wearing face masks due to personal health issues, physical discomfort, the absence or lack of symptoms of COVID-19 exhibited by the individual, alleged ineffectiveness at reducing COVID-19 transmission, or alleged exaggeration of the threats of the virus, while others object to governments having the power to force people to wear face coverings, such as passing certain mandates that require the population to wear it. Other factors which may make people less likely to wear masks includes a low death rate due to pandemic disease in one's hometown, and low mask-wearing among one's peers.There has been significant opposition to mandated mask-wearing for young children, with some public health researchers, teachers, and parents expressing concern over effects on children's language development and social emotional development. Consequences
Social consequences for refusing to wear a mask or wearing one improperly can range from anything from public shaming (including calling women who refuse to wear masks "Karens"), ejection or banning from an establishment either temporarily or permanently, and criminal prosecution. 
  Tweeps did share #science when  atributed symptoms requiring urgent medical attention, to #TheCovidMyth that symptoms caused by being in close proximity to vaccinated person.  Symptoms could be fibroids, cervical/ovarian #cancer, menstrual disorders or #COVID19 https://t.co/a1CQiBaAMQ [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. Risk of severe illness
The NHS of the United Kingdom has warned that those undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer and those with bone marrow cancers are vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19. In Sweden, individuals who recently got chemotherapy were found to be at a higher risk for developing severe illness following COVID-19. Symptoms:

Irregular periods. Infection in humans will present with fever, fatigue, and lesion on the skin. Signs and symptoms
Paravaccinia virus presents itself with blisters, nodules, or lesions about 4 mm in diameter, typically in the area that has made contact with livestock that is infected with bovine papular stomatitis. General signs of infection are also common, such as fever and fatigue. Oral or respiratory contraction may be more likely to cause systemic symptoms such as lesions across the whole bodyA person who has not previously been infected with paravaccinia virus should avoid contact with infected livestock to prevent contraction of disease. 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/2AwZUDJlGn [SEP] Their jobs demanded constant awareness and vigilance, reduced their autonomy, reduced access to social support, reduced self-care, uncertainty about the effects of long-term exposure to COVID-19 patients, and fear of infecting others.In some jurisdictions, schools were closed during the early months of the pandemic. Feeling pressure is normal in a crisis. COVID-19 has affected social structures across cultures, and for people living with PTSD, global measures that regulate the body by means of school closures, border restrictions, social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing, expose the ‘population to feelings of intense fear and helplessness’. Healthcare workers
Before COVID-19, healthcare workers already faced many stressors, including health risks, the possibility of infecting their household, and the stress of working with extremely sick patients. COVID-19's physical and emotional burden impacted healthcare workers increased rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout that impacted sleep, quality work/empathy towards patients, and suicide rates.Cases of anxiety and depression within healthcare workers who interact with COVID-19 patients increased by 1.57% and 1.52% respectively.One study reported that frontline nurses experience higher rates of anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.A cross-sectional study using an online survey in Southern California examined stress levels before and during the pandemic. The experiment concluded that nurses reported feeling moderate and high levels of stress compared to before the pandemic.A five-part questionnaire conducted among healthcare workers in Ghana to examine the correlation between COVID-19 and mental health. It suggested that psychological distress indices significantly correlated with items relating to COVID-19. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. 
 What Pfizer or the CDC will not tell you is that the vaccine could cause every single symptom of COVID and you could lose a week+ of your life trying to recover from the things that’s suppose to “protect” you from COVID [SEP] Vaccines as a cause of death
United States
Claims have been made that data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveals a hidden toll of COVID-19 vaccine related deaths. Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Specific populations
Based on the results of a preliminary study, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated with the COVID‑19 vaccine.A statement by the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) reported that the two agencies had reached a conclusion that the vaccine is safe and effective in children aged between 12 and 15 years.On 19 May 2021, experts commissioned by the Norwegian Medicines Agency concluded that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the likely cause of ten deaths of frail elderly patients in Norwegian nursing homes. They said that people with very short life expectancies have little to gain from vaccination, having a real risk of adverse reactions in the last days of life and of dying earlier.A 2021 report by the New South Wales Government (NSW Health) in Australia found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe for those with various forms of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, though it does note that the data on said groups is limited, due to their exclusion from many of the vaccine earlier trials held in 2020. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised on 9 December 2020 that people who have a history of "significant" allergic reaction should not receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine. Economics
Pfizer reported revenue of US$154 million from the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in 2020, and $36 billion in 2021.In July 2020, the vaccine development program Operation Warp Speed placed an advance order of US$1.95 billion with Pfizer to manufacture 100 million doses of a COVID‑19 vaccine for use in the United States if the vaccine was shown to be safe and effective.

   the vaccine can cause heart and brain issues too...maybe even cancer. Its been giving women fertility issues. We won't know till like 10yrs down the road any other side effects of this which could be same or worse than just getting covid immunity naturally. Remember Pox Parties? [SEP] With mortality ranging between 25 – 30% and lifelong consequences between 16 – 30% it was one of the most severe adverse events associated with this vaccination. Incidence
Vaccination with vaccinia virus was accompanied with a spectrum of adverse events. Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. In a situation with herd immunity to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.The non-specific effects should not be confused with the side effects of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases anaphylaxis). These serious complications (e.g., brain damage or death) are vastly more likely than vaccine adverse events. Experts caution that infection with COVID runs the risk of hospitalization, and increasingly common side effects such as MIS-C and long COVID.A number of news reports in the United States have suggested that parties have occurred with this intention early in the pandemic. The most common general adverse events in ≥20% of subjects were fatigue, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), gastrointestinal symptoms, and joint pain (arthralgia).In common with some other prefilled syringe vaccination products, the tip cap and the rubber plunger of the needleless prefilled syringes contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient. 
5/ In other words, the authors (who work at Oxford, home of the  vaccine) appear to have wanted to prove Covid-19 was more likely to cause these clots than vaccines.  BUT THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MRNA VACCINES ARE NEARLY AS LIKELY TO CAUSE CLOTS AS THE DNA VACCINES... [SEP] Clinical Trial
In December, Moderna started a clinical trial which would evaluate the vaccine's ability to provoke an immune response and its safety. This vaccine elicited immunity to adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7, the serotypes most often associated with acute respiratory disease. On March 16, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an adenovirus vaccine manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals under contract to the U.S. Army. References

  COVID-19:[NEWLINE]1) directly causes viral pneumonia[NEWLINE]2) can create environment conducive to development of secondary bacterial pneumonia [NEWLINE]3) can result in intubation, creating risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever, non-productive cough, runny nose, and systemic symptoms (e.g. Cause
Common causes of viral pneumonia are:

Influenza virus A and B
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Human parainfluenza viruses (in children)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)Rarer viruses that commonly result in pneumonia include:

Adenoviruses (in military recruits)
Metapneumovirus
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV)
HantavirusesViruses that primarily cause other diseases, but sometimes cause pneumonia include:

Herpes simplex virus (HSV), mainly in newborns or young children
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)
Measles virus
Rubella virus
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), mainly in people with immune system problems
Smallpox virus
Dengue virusThe most commonly identified agents in children are respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. Some viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia. As with all infectious diseases, viral pneumonia preys on the immunocompromised as well as individuals with one or more comorbidities especially those with:

Trauma
Severe burns
Diabetes
Malnutrition
Poverty

Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection, including bacterial pneumonia. In one cohort of aspiration pneumonia patients, overall three-year mortality was 40%.Studies have shown that aspiration pneumonia has been associated with an overall increased in-hospital mortality as compared with other forms of pneumonia. 
  now that we have that out of the way. yes, people can say that a heart attack is "covid-19", and they're probably wrong. then again, covid-19 can cause failure's in organs. and a heart attack could occur from that i think? she could have also had covid, and had a heart attack. [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. Mosquito-borne diseases
Although it is highly unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes, the pandemic nevertheless has a large impact on the control of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria or dengue fever. On February 19, the first U.S. patient with COVID-19 of unknown origin (a possible indication of community transmission) was hospitalized. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease and virus were sometimes called "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus", or "Wuhan pneumonia".In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively named it "2019-nCoV", short for "2019 Novel Coronavirus", or "2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease". A similar structure has also been used by the AP when referring to virus variants, for example, referring to it as the "Delta variant" rather than the "South African variant".On 11 February 2020, the WHO named the disease COVID-19 (short for coronavirus disease 2019). WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus, and D stands for disease, while 19 stands for the year that the outbreak was first detected. Use of "the Coronavirus" to refer to the COVID-19 pandemic which began in December 2019 has also been accepted. The Oxford English Dictionary noted that "the" is typically not used when referring to the disease, COVID-19, but is not uncommon when referring to the virus.Reference to the virus and/or the disease as "corona", "the corona", and "the rona" has also arisen in various parts of the world. 
I don’t think it’s that outlandish to assume that any lingering inflammation caused by covid infection would reignite briefly after the vaccine. Both cause a generalized inflammatory response. While vaccine can be more noticeable than the virus, it’s controlled & short-lived. 3/ [SEP] As with many other crises, the COVID-19 pandemic may compound existing vulnerabilities and inequalities experienced by children. Illness
When a child is infected with COVID-19, they are more likely to have an asymptomatic case, or one that is mild to moderate in severity. antibodies, CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cells reactive to other viral antigens than of SARS-CoV-2); and some protection offered from an increased Th2-response.Severe illness is possible, and in these instances respiratory support, such as a ventilator, may be required. Immunization efforts regarding diseases other than COVID-19 have been impacted, which will increase child deaths. Children and adolescents may also experience mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic itself, such as increased anxiety, as they might fear that they or their loved ones will get infected or they might worry about the future of the world. Most children do not experience any side effects; those that do occur are usually mild, such as fever, rash, pain at the site of injection, and joint stiffness; and are short-lived. While the vaccine is made with a live virus which can cause side effects, these are far fewer and less serious than the sickness and death caused by measles itself; side effects ranging from rashes to, rarely, convulsions, occur in a small percentage of recipients.Measles is common worldwide. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.The vaccine has non specific effects such as preventing respiratory infections, that may be greater than those of measles prevention alone. 
Ladies, you should know about this👉’ Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can cause temporary lymph node enlargement and result in a “false positive” mammogram’. 👈 we found this out the hard way. [SEP] A study in Andrologia found that Google searches relating to a supposed link between vaccination against COVID-19 and adverse effects on fertility increased following the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID vaccines in the United States, indicating that concerns about alleged impacts on fertility are a major contributor to vaccine hesitancy. Cancer
The website Natural News has published claims that mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 can cause cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressing proteins. Polio vaccine as a claimed COVID-19 carrier
Social media posts in Cameroon pushed a conspiracy theory that polio vaccines contained COVID-19, further complicating polio eradication beyond the logistical and funding difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Magnetization
Some social media users have falsely asserted COVID-19 vaccines cause people to become magnetized such that metal objects stick to their bodies. FALSE: Vaccines can cause the same disease that one is vaccinated against: A vaccine causing complete disease is extremely unlikely. FALSE: Vaccines will cause infertility: There is no supporting evidence or data that any vaccines have a negative impact on women's fertility. In 2020, as COVID-19 numbers rose and vaccinations started to roll out, the misinformation around vaccines causing infertility began to circulate. A joint statement of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine clearly states “that there is no evidence that the vaccine can lead to loss of fertility”. 
  Just b/c Covid-19 causes symptoms that look like the flu on the outside, we already know internal effects are different. How many kids & young people have silent cardiac damage? Can SARS-CoV-2 cause persistent or latent infection? (Google: persistent virus) [SEP] ICV infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur. There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute COVID-19 neurologic symptoms
The fraction of subjects who experience symptoms following an infection with SARS-CoV-2 varies by age. Neurological symptoms are not unique to COVID-19; infection with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also give rise to acute and delayed neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Cardiovascular system
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.

Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] Low testing may result in a high death rates, causing overestimates in mortality related modelling.In May 2022, the WHO report stated that there were 14.9 million deaths worldwide due to COVID-19 by the end of 2021, a figure that is 3 times higher than the official estimate of 5.4 million deaths. "Guidance for certifying COVID-19 deaths". Discussion paper COVID 19 Ascertaining cause of deaths: Myths & Facts. Guidance for Certifying Deaths Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19). A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.The U.S. experienced 882,000 "excess deaths" (i.e., deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years) between February 2020 and January 2022, which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID-19 during that period (835,000 deaths). "Coronavirus". Zero-COVID, also known as COVID-Zero and "Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support" (FTTIS), is a public health policy that was implemented by some countries, especially China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guan has advocated for increased vaccination and research into the efficacy of homegrown vaccines against new variants, as the vaccines would prevent death and reduce the impact of COVID-19, which can enable people to swiftly recover without interruption from COVID-19.Other opponents of the zero-COVID strategy argue that the strategy causes the economy to suffer, that before vaccinations were common, elimination strategies lowered herd immunity,  that zero-COVID is not sustainable, and that newer variants such as the Omicron variant are so transmissible that the zero-COVID strategy is no longer feasible.In May 2022, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented that the zero-COVID strategy is no longer considered sustainable based on "the behavior of the virus now" and future trends. 
   SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Though COVID-19 can cause this, the condition COVID-19 infection resulting in ICU admission with respiratory support is more accurately called ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] bc it results in alveolar injury. #My$0.02 [SEP] Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the first identified strain of the SARS coronavirus species, severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1; or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV) is a strain of coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the respiratory illness responsible for the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-1. There are two forms of respiratory distress syndrome:

ARDS, which is acute (or adult) respiratory distress syndrome
Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), which is a complication of premature birth, also known as hyaline membrane disease (HMD)Also, respiratory distress can mean:

Shortness of breath
Respiratory failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Terminology
ARDS is the severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), and of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), though there are other causes. "Acute respiratory distress syndrome". Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

SO, I will add, if someone had asthma and managed it their whole life then gets Covid and dies,  the Covid is what caused The death. [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. It is believed that a systemic pro-inflammatory state induced by some causes of obesity may contribute to airway inflammation, leading to asthma. Obesity and asthma
The low grade systemic inflammation of obesity has been show to worsen lung function in asthma and increase the risk of developing an asthma exacerbation. A study from Mexico found that obesity alone was responsible for a 2.7 times increased risk of death from COVID-19, while comorbidities with diabetes, immunosuppression or high blood pressure increased the risk further. Other health problems compound the chronic complications of diabetes such as smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and lack of regular exercise. Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. However, diabetes does cause higher morbidity, mortality and operative risks with these conditions. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19, are more common and severe among individuals with poorly controlled diabetes.

== References == They are also referred to as cell-mediated immune (CMI) vaccines.It is thought that they can be more effective than conventional B-cell vaccines for protection from microbes that hide inside host cells, and viruses (such as HIV or influenza) that mutate rapidly.T-cell vaccines underwent clinical trials for HIV/AIDS.As of July 2012 none have been approved.As December 2020, The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab passed the FDA's emergency use authorization  and became the first FDA authorized T cell vaccine. Pidotimod is an immunostimulant. Host-mediated pathogenesis is often important because the host can respond aggressively to infection with the result that host defense mechanisms do damage to host tissues while the infection is being countered (e.g., cytokine storm). Some viral virulence factors confer ability to replicate during the defensive inflammation responses of the host such as during virus-induced fever. The term "neurovirulent" is used for viruses such as rabies and herpes simplex which can invade the nervous system and cause disease there. 
     How can cardiovascular damage be anecdotal? I believe the science is showing that Covid can cause long term effects. It is the second cause of death. This virus can not be wished away no matter how strong minded you are. [SEP] Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. See also

Another “deadly variant” that coincidentally attacks 12& younger right when needing Covid-19 Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA when vaccines are causing blood-clots, heart attacks & heart inflammation. Keep in mind heart disease/ failure is the #1 cause of death in U.S🤡🌎 https://t.co/1QyOgbSgYM [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. Risk of severe illness
The NHS of the United Kingdom has warned that those undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer and those with bone marrow cancers are vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19. In Sweden, individuals who recently got chemotherapy were found to be at a higher risk for developing severe illness following COVID-19. Recommendations
The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends that oncologists should remain ready to adjust their clinical routines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Carditis (pl. carditides) is the inflammation of the heart.It is usually studied and treated by specifying it as:
Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium
Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle
Endocarditis is the inflammation of the endocardium
Pancarditis, also called perimyoendocarditis, is the inflammation of the entire heart: the pericardium, the myocardium and the endocardium
Reflux carditis refers to a possible outcome of esophageal reflux (also known as GERD), and involves inflammation of the esophagus/stomach mucosa

I have issues with thrombosis & embolisms and stuff and tbh I'm more afraid to get the virus than anything b/c covid is known to cause really bad inflammation,  hypercoagulation, clots etc. Much rather be vaccinated. Better odds. [SEP] Signs and symptoms
The thrombosis events associated with the COVID‑19 vaccine may occur 4–28 days after its administration and mainly affects women under 55. Regulatory status
According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as of 28 March 2021, the reported number of cases of embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination is lower than the rate of such events in the general population overall. COVID‑19 is a very serious disease with high hospitalization and death rates and every day COVID is still causing thousands of deaths across the EU. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". The advice is "based on the increasing risk of severe outcomes from COVID‑19 in older adults (and hence a higher benefit from vaccination) and a potentially increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following AstraZeneca vaccination in those under 50 years." "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". Acquired
A number of acquired conditions augment the risk of thrombosis. Some people have a higher risk of developing thrombosis and its possible development into thromboembolism. 
Percentage of total cancer deaths are 21.3%.and you're worried about COVID-19?[NEWLINE]Race & sex also play a role in a person’s risk of developing cancer, depending on the type. That said, lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer in both men & women. [SEP] Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Australia and is responsible for one fifth of cancer diagnosis in the nation. Prevalence
As of 2018, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in Australia. There were 9,168 deaths due to lung cancer in 2018, with 5,229 males and 3,969 females reported by Cancer Australia. Importance of infectious causes of cancer mortality worldwide
Worldwide in 2015, the most common causes of cancer death were lung cancer (1.6 million deaths), liver cancer (745,000 deaths), and stomach cancer (723,000 deaths). Lung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide, with 2.2 million cases in 2020 resulting in 1.8 million deaths. Epidemiology
Worldwide, lung cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, and the leading cause of cancer death. In 2020, 2.2 million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.8 million people died from lung cancer, representing 18% of all cancer deaths. Globally, around 8% of men and 6% of women develop lung cancer in their lifetimes. 
  Covid is turning out to be a vascular virus with respiratory symptoms. Covid causes heart failure and heart attacks. [SEP] : e279 : Table 5  In addition, viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. COVID-19 Cardiomyopathy
Patients with Covid-19 frequently experience heart issues. According to studies, people who have had previous cardiovascular conditions like cardiomyopathy, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or arrhythmia are more likely to become critically ill from SARS-CoV-2 infection. While myocarditis may develop over periods ranging from hours to months, patients typically present with signs and symptoms that resemble heart failure, including the following:
Since myocarditis is often due to a viral illness, many patients experience symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection including a fever, rash, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pains, and easily becoming tired. More specifically, fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a distinct, rapid onset of severe heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain, that develop over the course of hours to days. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect. https://t.co/NJQ1EbxP2I [SEP] In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission. Overview
Some less common symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; however the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and loss of taste and smell. Loss of smell
In about 60% of COVID-19 patients, chemosensory deficit are reported, including losing their sense of smell, either partially or fully.This symptom, if it is present at all, often appears early in the illness. Loss of smell increases foodborne illness due to inability to detect spoiled food, and may increase fire hazards due to inability to detect smoke. Loss of smell may also be the result of inflammation in the olfactory bulb.A June 2020 systematic review found a 29–54% prevalence of olfactory dysfunction for people with COVID-19, while an August 2020 study using a smell-identification test reported that 96% of people with COVID-19 had some olfactory dysfunction, and 18% had total smell loss. As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~70% for loss of smell.A disturbance in smell or taste is more commonly found in younger people, and perhaps because of this, it is correlated with a lower risk of medical complications. Loss of taste and chemesthesis
In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily experience changes in how food tastes (dysgeusia or ageusia). As of January 2021, the mechanism for taste and chemesthesis symptoms were not well understood.A June 2020 systematic review found a 24–54% prevalence of gustatory dysfunction for people with COVID-19. 
‘We made a big mistake’ — COVID vaccine spike protein travels from injection site, can cause organ damage https://t.co/i1nZiEhmiX [SEP] Due to the outbreak of SARS and the COVID-19 pandemic, antibodies to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have been extensively studied. Misinformation
During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccination misinformation about COVID-19 circulated on social media platforms related to the spike protein's role in COVID-19 vaccines. Spike proteins were said to be dangerously "cytotoxic" and mRNA vaccines containing them therefore in themselves dangerous. Spike proteins were also said to be "shed" by vaccinated people, in an erroneous allusion to the phenomenon of vaccine-induced viral shedding, which is a rare effect of live-virus vaccines unlike those used for COVID-19. Serious injuries and deaths caused by vaccines are very rare, and the idea that severe events are common has been classed as a "common misconception about immunization" by the WHO. They go on to write:

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are concerned that, given the anticipated scale of the COVID-19 immunization campaign and new vaccine technologies employed, mass immunization may result in a small number of Canadians experiencing serious AEFIs, despite adherence to best practices. Operating under this estimate, we anticipate 25 Canadians may suffer a serious health outcome following COVID-19 vaccination, or 0.1 per 100,000 doses. See also

Covid seems to wake up the same age-old mechanism in our white blood cells that causes long-term brain and nerve inflammation in multiple sclerosis (an ancient virus that has become part of our DNA). It could explain why certain people get neurological #LongCovid symptoms 🤕 https://t.co/5wnIuiQveQ [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Chronic effects of COVID-19 can lead to a prolonged inflammatory state, which can increase symptoms resembling an autoimmune disorder. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Another study identified neuroinflammation and an activation of adaptive and innate immune cells in the brain stem of COVID-19 patients. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Yes! Oral contraceptives cause more blood clots and nobody is doing anything about that!!! Like 1 per 1,000 compared to basically 1 per MILLION with the Covid vaccine. Maddening. [SEP] Notes

"The Pill and the Doctor/Patient Relationship," PBS transcript, https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/filmmore/pt.html Other blood clotting pathway mutations that increase the risk of clots include factor V Leiden. Increased production of prothrombin heightens the risk of blood clotting. Most individuals do not require treatment but do need to be cautious during periods when the possibility of blood clotting are increased; for example, during pregnancy, after surgery, or during long flights. Occasionally, blood-thinning medication may be indicated to reduce the risk of clotting.Heterozygous carriers who take combined birth control pills are at a 15-fold increased risk of VTE, while carriers also heterozygous with factor V Leiden have an approximate 20-fold higher risk. Oral contraceptives should generally be avoided in women with the mutation as they increase the thrombotic risk. Despite the increased prevalence of contraceptives, unplanned pregnancies are still a major concern with married women having 0.7 more children they desired. Contraception is typically considered safer than pregnancy, especially in patients with medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. 
  Vaccines allow you to build immunity without suffering the damaging effects of the disease itself. COVID-19 can cause serious long-term health problems and even be fatal. All of this can be avoided by getting vaccinated.  https://t.co/segNhg4ePd [SEP] Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. It is widely accepted that the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. Preliminary research indicates that influenza vaccination does not prevent COVID-19, but may reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. 
   immunity escape you talk about is not proven concerning the effect of this vaccin. Which is proved is it's his high  %age of efficiency against covid and which is certain is that covid is a mortal virus which also can cause severe after effects if you don t die. [SEP] A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.The vaccine has non specific effects such as preventing respiratory infections, that may be greater than those of measles prevention alone. Aaron's death was reported as being due to natural causes, and medical officials did not believe the COVID-19 vaccine had any adverse effect on his health.In October 7, 2022, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued a press release discouraging men aged 18 to 39 from taking the COVID-19 vaccine since a study by the Florida Department of Health concluded vaccinated men of the age group had an 84% increased likelihood of dying from heart problems. Preliminary research indicates that influenza vaccination does not prevent COVID-19, but may reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. Antigenic escape, immune escape, immune evasion or escape mutation occurs when the immune system of a host, especially of a human being, is unable to respond to an infectious agent: the host's immune system is no longer able to recognize and eliminate a pathogen, such as a virus. Antigenic escape is not only crucial for the host's natural immune response, but also for the resistance against vaccinations. Escape from vaccination
Consequences of recent vaccines
While vaccines are created to strengthen the immune response to pathogens, in many cases these vaccines are not able to cover the wide variety of strains a pathogen may have. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. It is widely accepted that the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization. 
 So what? COVID-19 is thousands of times more likely to be fatal or cause long term effects. This is a global crisis and war on a virus. People need to calibrate their thinking a little. This obsession with minute vaccine risks is dangerous and unethical. [SEP] A French virologist likewise falsely claimed that antibodies from vaccines had created and strengthened COVID-19 variants through a previously debunked theory of Antibody-dependent Enhancement.A related debunked theory, out of India, claimed that COVID-19 vaccines were lowering people's ability to withstand new variants instead of boosting immunity.The website Natural News published an article in July 2021 claiming that CDC director Rochelle Walensky admitted that COVID-19 vaccines do not protect against the delta variant and that vaccinated people could be superspreaders due to having a higher viral load. The organizers, including medical professionals, charged between $10 and $17 for each dose, and more than 2,600 people paid to receive the vaccine.Interpol issued a global alert in December 2020 to law enforcement agencies in its member countries to be on the lookout for organized crime networks targeting COVID-19 vaccines, physically and online. A frequent fallacy consisted in concluding on the ineffectiveness (or low effectiveness) of vaccines after noticing the apparently high proportion of vaccinated patients among COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths, without taking into account the high proportion of vaccinated people among the general population, thus committing the base rate fallacy; or without taking into account the tendency of people at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 to be vaccinated in priority, thus ignoring the Yule–Simpson effect.In the United Kingdom, a report from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), published in March 2021, predicted that 60% of hospitalisations and 70% of deaths would be among people who had received two doses of the vaccine, despite the latter remaining highly effective. Spike protein cytotoxicity
In 2021, anti-vaccination misinformation circulated on social media saying that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were "very dangerous" and "cytotoxic". As of 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy was considered one of the top ten threats to global health by the World Health Organization. Misinformation has spread claiming that people died due to COVID-19 vaccination. A 2021 study found that misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media "induced a decline in intent [to vaccinate] of 6.2 percentage points in the [United Kingdom] and 6.4 percentage points in the [United States] among those who said they would definitely accept a vaccine".Social media is again the leading platform for the rapid spreading of vaccine misinformation during a pandemic. It is useful to pair scientific evidence with stories that connect to the belief and value system of the audience.While social media companies have taken recent steps to reduce the presence of vaccine misinformation on their platforms, misinformed users and their social groups remain. 
  And yes they’re included in the numbers. Covid causes inflammation in your circulatory system which can lead to things like blood clots and heart attacks. [SEP] This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls. Inflammation may play a causal role in coronary artery disease and subsequent myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis. Increased levels of inflammation may lead to higher risk of clotting as well as an increased risk of stent/device subsequent thrombosis. Age-related systemic chronic inflammation is associated with several cytokines including CXCL9, TRAIL, interferon gamma, CCL11, and CXCL1, and a proposed measurement of chronic systemic inflammation based on these cytokines (iAge) correlates with immunosenescence and predicts risk for cardiovascular disease, frailty syndrome, and multimorbidity. Comorbidities
It is firmly established that systemic markers for inflammation predict coronary heart disease complications with or without existing heart disease. Inflammation also plays a role in diabetes risk and new research continues to support this conclusion.Research suggests chronic inflammation plays a major role in COVID-19 morbidity. In severe cases, COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm which contributes to excessive and uncontrolled inflammation of organs, particularly respiratory tissues. Individuals with abnormal cytokine production, such as those with obesity or systemic chronic inflammation, have poorer health outcomes from COVID-19.

If you’ve had COVID, your first vaccine dose may cause worse side effects. Here’s why https://t.co/NENybrfQbp [SEP] Adverse events
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while "any vaccine can cause side effects", most side effects are minor, primarily including sore arms or a mild fever. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Typical side effects are stronger and more common in younger people and in subsequent doses, and up to 20% of people report a disruptive level of side effects after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. For example, although vaccination may trigger some side effects, the effects experienced from an infection could be worse. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
  See this please to get the seriousness of the matter at hand. Dr Mark Gordon has a good idea of what Long Covid is and compares it to brain injury caused by explosions. This is brain inflammation and damage. Don’t work through it. Strokes, fits...etc. [NEWLINE]https://t.co/sQAcI3MnoU [SEP] These sensations can be very painful and may last up to two or three years.

The NHS of the United Kingdom has warned that those undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer and those with bone marrow cancers are vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19. Long COVID-19
Even though many COVID-19 patients recover within 2–6 weeks of the onset of symptoms, some develop symptoms that come and go for months. The possibility has been raised, but needs to be investigated further, that patients with long COVID-19  may be predisposed to the development of lung cancer. an infection of the lungs not related to the medicinal drugs the patient is taking. Repetitive microtrauma which are not allowed time to heal can result in the development of more serious conditions. Because of the slow and progressive onset of this internal injury, the condition is often ignored until the symptoms become acute, often resulting in disabling injury. 
Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt told Parliament that not one life had been lost to Covid this year.

  So sorry for your loss. Even the J&J is way less likely to cause serious side effects than COVID. There’s a risk for sure w/any of the vaccines, but for the majority of Americans (w/o an allergy to ingredients in vaccine &no autoimmune disorders), the risk is way less than COVID. [SEP] Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". The Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, sold under the brand name Jcovden, is a COVID‑19 vaccine that was developed by Janssen Vaccines in Leiden, Netherlands, and its Belgian parent company Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of American company Johnson & Johnson.It is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus that has been modified to contain the gene for making the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID‑19. In June 2023, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at the request of its manufacturer.Because cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported after receipt of the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends "preferential use of mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines over the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine, including both primary and booster doses administered to prevent COVID‑19, for all persons aged 18 years of age and older.

Review of Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) safety monitoring data by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through 21 April 2021, (by which time 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine had been administered), showed that "97% of reported reactions after vaccine receipt were nonserious, consistent with preauthorization clinical trials data. Rare side effects (that occurred in less than 1 in 1,000 people) are hypersensitivity (allergy) and itchy rash.An increased risk of the rare and potentially fatal thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been associated with mainly younger female recipients of the vaccine. The symptoms occurred 6–13 days after they had received the vaccination, and it was reported that one woman had died and a second woman had been hospitalized in critical condition.In April, the FDA and the CDC determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen COVID‑19 Vaccine in the US should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume. "COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen Safety Updates". Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. 
           I believe mine was a fibro flare caused from vaccine. It’s been 13 days since vaccine & Tim’s just now getting sick. So not sure what’s going on with him. Either a stomach virus - there’s one going around or Covid cause it takes 2-4 weeks after vaccine to be fully immune. [SEP] When symptoms occur, they typically last 8 weeks and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is 2–6 weeks, with an average of 28 days.The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with more than 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infections.Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months:
Fatigue
Fever
Nausea
Appetite loss
Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes owing to hyperbilirubinemia
Bile is removed from the bloodstream and excreted in the urine, giving it a dark amber color
Diarrhea
Light or clay-colored faeces (acholic faeces)
Abdominal discomfort

Extrahepatic manifestations
Joint pains, red cell aplasia, pancreatitis and generalized lymphadenopathy are the possible extrahepatic manifestations. Recovery from symptoms following infection may take several weeks or months. Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion. If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. 
      Incorrect. Vaccine do not normally cause blood clots. Nor do viruses...SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine do.  We cannot ignore this. We can rationally protect ourselves from harm. [SEP] These vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are associated with vaccines using an adenovirus system (Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca). Causes
The rare simultaneous occurrence of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) with blood clots after vaccination raised the original concern about this condition. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine.

  Of course it is - my own mothers lungs where so damaged by Covid it caused Covid-pneumonitis in which the lungs inflame and cause more damage, it took 2 months until her lungs barely functioning which led to her death, this was caused by Covid therefore the caused by Covid... [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause. In addition to the effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other organs and can lead to illness affecting many different bodily functions. As with all infectious diseases, viral pneumonia preys on the immunocompromised as well as individuals with one or more comorbidities especially those with:

Trauma
Severe burns
Diabetes
Malnutrition
Poverty
Environmental Exposure

Chronic alveolar lung disease can be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, alveolar cell carcinoma, mineral oil pneumonia, sarcoidosis (alveolar form), lymphoma, tuberculosis, metastases, or desquamative interstitial pneumonia. If unresolved, continued inflammation can result in irreparable damage such as pulmonary fibrosis.Pneumonitis is distinguished from pneumonia on the basis of causation as well as its manifestation. 
 There is a round of coronavirus cold every fall and winter, so 93% of people are immune to -ncov. Immunity is achieved through lymphocytes. After 2019-ncov infection, lymphocytes were depleted. Antipyretics and corticosteroids suppress lymphocyte immunity and cause COVID-19. [SEP] Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a provisional name given to coronaviruses of medical significance before a permanent name is decided upon. Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections normally mild, such as the common cold (caused by human coronaviruses in ~15% of cases), cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. All coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show depleted CD56bright NK cells, but CD56dim is only depleted in patients with severe COVID-19. The common cold, or simply the cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract. The transmission of COVID-19 is the passing of coronavirus disease 2019 from person to person. Adults with severe to critical COVID-19, or severe immune suppression (immunocompromised persons), may remain infectious (i.e., shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2) for up to 20 days after symptoms begin.Patients who are tested positive to the virus again after recovery, in case they weren't being reinfected, is found to be not transmitting the virus to others.Nearly a third of people with COVID-19 remain contagious five days after the onset of symptoms or a positive test. Effect of vaccination
The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines provide effective protection against COVID-19, including against severe disease, hospitalisation, and death, and "a growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission" as chains of transmission are interrupted by vaccines. While fully vaccinated people can still become infected and potentially transmit the virus to others (particularly in areas of widespread community transmission), they do so at a much lower rate than unvaccinated people. 
 Oh well! This is all based on a flawed testing method that produces false positive results! Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] Allegations of inflated death counts
In August 2020, President Donald Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory alleging that COVID-19 deaths are systematically overcounted, and that only 6% of the reported deaths in the United States were actually from the disease. A FactCheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.The U.S. experienced 882,000 "excess deaths" (i.e., deaths above the baseline expected from normal mortality in previous years) between February 2020 and January 2022, which is somewhat higher than the officially recorded mortality from COVID-19 during that period (835,000 deaths). "Coronavirus". United States
In May 2021, following an analysis by the IHME that the true count of fatalities due to COVID-19 in United States was above 900,000, Anthony Fauci said that he had "no doubt" there was undercounting of COVID-19 deaths. Low testing may result in a high death rates, causing overestimates in mortality related modelling.In May 2022, the WHO report stated that there were 14.9 million deaths worldwide due to COVID-19 by the end of 2021, a figure that is 3 times higher than the official estimate of 5.4 million deaths.

 If u have had covid u don’t need the vaccine it can cause problems by adding more antibodies to ur other antibiotics that devel in ur body from having the virus [SEP] Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals, and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.At least 19 countries have no-fault compensation programs to provide compensation for those with severe adverse effects of vaccination. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. These pathogens could possibly infect vaccinated people, due to the pathogen's ability to mutate when it is able to live in unvaccinated hosts. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. Patients that receive a lower dose than recommended of a vaccine do not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine to ensure immunity.In order for a vaccine to be effective, an individual must respond to the pathogens in a vaccine through the adaptive branch of the immune system and that response must be stored  in an individual's immunological memory.

  COVID-19 causes inflammation throughout vtge body, including the brain. Inflammation has been implicated as an underlying cause for depression and is a known cause for dementia. [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Many patients with COVID-19 experience psychological symptoms that can arise either from the direct actions of the virus, the chronic increase in inflammation or secondary effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acutely by PCR, and is thought to enter via the olfactory system. Chronic COVID-19 neurologic symptoms
A study of 236,379 COVID-19 survivors showed that the "estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months" after diagnosed infection was 33.62% with 12.84% "receiving their first such diagnosis" and higher risks being associated with COVID-19 severity.Neuroinflammation as a result of viral infection (e.g., influenza, herpes simplex, and hepatitis C) has been linked to the onset of psychiatric illness across numerous publications. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people across the globe. Anxiety and depression
An increase of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic is a commonly held perception worldwide. 
So kind of a bad choice when your target for the vaccine can cause side effects in its own right.  Still this vaccine has been a huge net positive but hopefully the he next generation of covid vaccines finds something a little less harmful as the target https://t.co/Efos6smnvg [SEP] Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. In a situation with herd immunity to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.The non-specific effects should not be confused with the side effects of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases anaphylaxis). It was subsequently also described in the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) leading to suspension of its use until its safety had been reassessed. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective, it prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". The reasoning is because in the 20-29 age range the benefits to individual of vaccination were less as their likelihood of harm from COVID‑19 is less and closer to the potential risk of harm from the vaccine (at a medium exposure risk with COVID‑19 infection cases running at a rate of 60 per 100,000). The EMA states the overall risk-benefit for the Janssen vaccine remains positive.On 16 December 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should be preferred over the Janssen vaccine, following growing concerns about rare blood clots. Syndrome identification
A number of COVID‑19 vaccines began to become approved and available at scale in December 2020, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up at scale from the beginning of 2021, among them the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, based on an adenovirus vector and internally termed AZD1222.On 11 March 2021, the EMA issued a statement noting Denmark had suspended AZD1222 vaccinations due to a vaccinated patient dying with blood clots. 
 Diabetes causes blood sugar spikes. So does eating sugar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blood sugar spikes cause arterial inflammation, which increases risk for both heart disease and covid complications.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]People who ate more sugar, died sooner.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All true facts. Rationalize them as you will. [SEP] Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. However, diabetes does cause higher morbidity, mortality and operative risks with these conditions. Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and about 75% of deaths in people with diabetes are due to coronary artery disease. The following is a list of disorders that may increase the risk of diabetes:

Pathophysiology
Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1. Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations. ).The increasing rates of prediabetes and diabetes suggest lifestyle and/or environmental factors that contribute to prediabetes. Eating food for example leads to elevated blood sugar levels. The consequent fall in blood glucose is indicated as the reason for the "sugar crash". 
The predominant symptoms of ‘long COVID’ are psychological in nature, with anxiety and depression being most common. But those of course are also exactly the conditions which have been caused in, literally, millions of people, especially young people, by the lockdowns. [SEP] Predictors and potential causes of mental health symptoms
The known causes of mental health issues during the pandemic included fear of infection, stigma associated with infection, isolation (imposed by individuals sheltering on their own or in compliance with lockdowns), and masks. Their jobs demanded constant awareness and vigilance, reduced their autonomy, reduced access to social support, reduced self-care, uncertainty about the effects of long-term exposure to COVID-19 patients, and fear of infecting others.In some jurisdictions, schools were closed during the early months of the pandemic. Many young people struggled with boredom, fear, and sleep problems.A collection of 29 studies posted in August 2021 by Jamanetwork showed that the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety had doubled during COVID-19. Spanish Women
A 2020 study of Barcelona women compared their anxiety and depression levels during the initial days of lockdown and then 5 weeks after lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those admitted to the ICU while battling their direct infection of the COVID-19 virus experience mental health consequences as a result of this stay, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Chronic COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms
A 2021 article published in Nature reports increased risk of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and substance use disorders among post-acute COVID-19 patients. In 2020, a Lancet Psychiatry review reported occurrence of the following post-COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms: traumatic memories (30%), decreased memory (19%), fatigue (19%), irritability (13%), insomnia (12%) and depressed mood (11%). 
       Not all brands of the vaccine can cause problems, there are brands that have higher lethal rates than others. The death rate of COVID is said to be 10%. It is probable that some vaccines (Maybe Johnson& Johnson) have a higher lethal rate than that [SEP] Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. A March 2020 New York Times article described the political effects of this market structure: "government and international health organizations know that any vaccine developed in a lab will ultimately be manufactured by large pharmaceutical firms. "Concentration and monopolization of the manufacture of specific drugs has also led to supply shortages, and significant healthcare costs for employing people to track down hard-to-get drugs.This oligopoly power allows vaccine manufacturers to engage in price discrimination, and vaccine prices are often two orders of magnitude higher than the manufacturer's stated manufacturing costs, as of 2015. In 2021 the CDC reported that unvaccinated people were 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die than fully vaccinated people.CDC reported that vaccine effectiveness fell from 91% against Alpha to 66% against Delta. After a booster dose (usually with an mRNA vaccine), vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was at 70%–75%, and the effectiveness against severe disease was expected to be higher.According to early December 2021 CDC data, "unvaccinated adults were about 97 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people who had received boosters".A meta analysis looking into COVID-19 vaccine differences in immunosuppressed individuals found that people with a weakened immune system, are less able to produce neutralizing antibodies. Almost all pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals with COVID were unvaccinated.A US study of 46,079 pregnancies concluded that COVID vaccination is safe and does not raise the risk of preterm birth or small size babies. Trials indicate many vaccines developed for the initial strain have lower efficacy for some variants against symptomatic COVID-19. Side effects
All vaccines can have minor side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the introduction of a foreign substance into the body. 
vaccines for COVID-19 are stopped as a matter of urgency in order to protect the public from serious harm and death.   It is also documented that Polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues relating to fertility.  9 [SEP] However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021. In July 2021, The BMJ reported that countries have thrown out over 250,000 vaccine doses as supply exceeded demand and strict laws prevented the sharing of vaccines. A survey of young women in the United Kingdom later found that more than a quarter would refuse COVID-19 vaccines out of concerns for their effects on fertility. A study in Andrologia found that Google searches relating to a supposed link between vaccination against COVID-19 and adverse effects on fertility increased following the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID vaccines in the United States, indicating that concerns about alleged impacts on fertility are a major contributor to vaccine hesitancy. Vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contained tissue from aborted fetuses. They do this partly to counteract vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories. On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of about a million doses of the vaccine whilst they examine the data and await advice on how to proceed.In a study reported in March and May 2021, the efficacy of the Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) was tested in a preliminary randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 2684 participants who were negative for COVID at baseline testing.

For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect.

Infectious mononucleosis
Epstein–Barr can cause infectious mononucleosis, also known as 'glandular fever', 'mono' and 'Pfeiffer's disease'. EBV is a double-stranded DNA virus.The virus causes infectious mononucleosis ("mono" or "glandular fever"). Post-infectious chronic fatigue syndrome has also been associated with EBV infection.EBV has also been implicated in several other diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, stomach cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, multiple sclerosis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.Specifically, EBV infected B-cells have been shown to reside within the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis patients, and a 2022 study of 10 million soldiers' historical blood samples showed that "Individuals who were not infected with the Epstein-Barr virus virtually never get multiple sclerosis. It's only after Epstein-Barr virus infection that the risk of multiple sclerosis jumps up by over 30-fold," and that only EBV of many infections had such a clear connection with the disease.Additional diseases that have been linked to EBV include Gianotti–Crosti syndrome, erythema multiforme, acute genital ulcers, and oral hairy leukoplakia. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. 
Similar to medications and other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. Vaccine reactions are rare. Info about side effects: https://t.co/0zWPiWE9RX  VIDEO: https://t.co/kgwjzNMEnu [SEP] Adverse events
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while "any vaccine can cause side effects", most side effects are minor, primarily including sore arms or a mild fever. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. 
   A statement that flies in the face of “Pick up your Pence” as head of the Covid Task Force. Pence is anti-science, said tobacco doesn’t cause cancer, increased HIV transmission as Governor, and Trump believes windmills cause cancer. Perdue downplayed Covid ! Vote him out! [SEP] This was particularly true with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, but also included suppressing research on climate change and weakening or eliminating environmental regulations.Trump and his appointees pressured federal health and science agencies to take particular actions that Trump favored and to support his public pronouncements. As of late July, Trump was still promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, despite the position of the NIH that the drug was "very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19".In August, Trump pushed to get speedy approval of convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment, because he wanted to be able to announce it as a treatment breakthrough at the August 2020 Republican National Convention. Before retiring in September 2020, Sinks issued a rare, strongly worded "dissenting scientific opinion" against the adoption of a new regulation, pushed by Trump's appointees, that would require the EPA to disregard scientific or medical research that did not make raw data (including personal health information) public. The statement was issued the day after Trump suggested he might veto an FDA proposal to raise the standards for emergency approval of a coronavirus vaccine. After Trump's comments, "hundreds of calls" were made to the Maryland health department emergency hotline "asking if it was right to ingest Clorox or alcohol cleaning products—whether that was going to help them fight the virus", stated the Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan. The revelation of the recordings led to criticism that Trump had deliberately downplayed the threat of the virus to the public, while he actually knew the severity of the virus.As reported cases reached new record highs in October 2020, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy named "ending the Covid-19 pandemic" as a top accomplishment of the Trump administration.In October 2020, Trump falsely asserted, "Our doctors get more money if someone dies from COVID. His instructions to the caller were subsequently reversed by city officials.In summer 2020, then-U.S. Presidential nominee Joe Biden argued that Trump's response to the pandemic was to offer "denials, delays, and distractions, many of which were xenophobic". In July 2020, Biden also made various claims against the Trump administration's pandemic response that were rated misleading and inaccurate in a fact check by The New York Times.From spring 2020 to early 2021, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration hid the number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes in an effort to downplay the death totals for the state of New York.A 2020 study by researchers from Northeastern, Harvard, Northwestern and Rutgers universities found that older registered voters of all political orientations shared more COVID-19 stories from fake news websites on Twitter, with Republicans over the age of 65 being the most likely to share COVID-19 stories from fake news websites.In a February 2021 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that "most signs point to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, as the source of Covid-19", a theory that has been described as 'extremely unlikely' by World Health Organization scientists.In a December 2021 interview United States President Joe Biden falsely claimed that "People vaccinated for COVID-19 “do not spread the disease to anyone else.” On January 2, 2022, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal Twitter account was permanently suspended for "repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy", according to a Twitter spokesperson. 
   Might sound counter intuitive, but even the common cold (which are caused by corona viruses) may help our immune system recognise Covid and respond to it better.  Maybe the same happens with the flu. [SEP] A flu-like syndrome can also be caused by an influenza vaccine or other vaccines, and by opioid withdrawal in physically dependent individuals. During the 2009 flu pandemic in the United States, the CDC advised physicians to "consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu, or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the 7 days preceding their illness onset." The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.There is no vaccine for the common cold. Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Common cold
Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus. 
Study: Pfizer's RNA-based covid vaccine could cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases, so its approval was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit. https://t.co/CyX9P1k9J5 https://t.co/vSTarg3dIG [SEP] Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. On 23 August 2021, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They said that people with very short life expectancies have little to gain from vaccination, having a real risk of adverse reactions in the last days of life and of dying earlier.A 2021 report by the New South Wales Government (NSW Health) in Australia found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe for those with various forms of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, though it does note that the data on said groups is limited, due to their exclusion from many of the vaccine earlier trials held in 2020. Adverse effects
In large phase 3 trials for the vaccine there were no reported serious safety findings, and it observed low incidence of serious adverse events.Most side effects of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine are mild to moderate in severity and are gone within a few days. It is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be approved for national use after undergoing large scale trials, and the first mRNA vaccine to be authorized for use in humans. Standard
On 19 December 2020, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) granted temporary authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine for regular use, two months after receiving the application, saying the vaccine fully complied with the requirements of safety, efficacy and quality. The recommendation was accepted by the European Commission the same day.On 23 February 2021, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine under its standard marketing authorization procedure. On 23 August 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged sixteen years and older.The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine was authorized in Canada on 16 September 2021, for people aged twelve and older.In July 2022, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged twelve years and older.In September 2022, the CHMP of the EMA recommended converting the conditional marketing authorizations of the vaccine into standard marketing authorizations.

It is more commonly associated with animals than with humans.One of the most common forms seen by veterinarians is mouth actinobacillosis of cattle, due to Actinobacillus lignieresii. Actinobacillus suis is an important disease of pigs of all ages and can lead to severe morbidity and sudden death. There are generally one or two cases of actinobacillosis per herd found in adult cows, foals or adult horses, and other similar animals.

    It doesn't matter that only 14k people died of covid alone. This is completely fucking irrelevant, especially considering the fact that Covid literally causes things like pneumonia, which are included in that CDC page. [SEP] This pandemic killed an estimated 1–4 million people worldwide. However, the case fatality rate might not be an adequate measure of pandemic severity during a pandemic response because:
Deaths may lag several weeks behind cases, making the case fatality rate an underestimate
The total number of cases may not be known, making the case fatality rate an overestimate
A single case fatality rate for the entire population may obscure the effect on vulnerable sub-populations, such as children, the elderly, those with chronic conditions, and members of certain racial and ethnic minorities
Fatalities alone may not account for the full effects of the pandemic, such as absenteeism or demand on healthcare servicesTo account for the limitations of measuring the case fatality rate alone, the PSAF rates severity of a disease outbreak on two dimensions: clinical severity of illness in infected persons; and the transmissibility of the infection in the population. Every year 155 million children under 5 get sick and 1.6 million lose their lives to pneumonia, more than all child deaths combined from AIDS, malaria and measles. The CDC estimates that, between February 2020 and September 2021, only 1 in 1.3 COVID-19 deaths were attributed to COVID-19. From March 1, 2020, through the end of 2020, there were 522,368 excess deaths in the United States, or 22.9% more deaths than would have been expected in that time period.In February 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, a shortage of tests made it impossible to confirm all possible COVID-19 cases and resulting deaths, so the early numbers were likely undercounts.The following numbers are based on CDC data, which is incomplete. After a group of epidemiologists requested revisions in how the CDC counts cases and deaths, the CDC in mid-April 2020 updated its guidance for counting COVID-19 cases and deaths to recommend that U.S. states report both confirmed and probable ones, though the decision is left to each state.On September 25, 2020, The Lancet published the largest study at the time to measure COVID-19 antibody levels in the US population, finding that less than ten percent of the U.S. population had been exposed. At the time of the publication of the study, Anand announced that researchers would monitor the study participants for months to help determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation tactics.As of May 2021, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that there had been approximately 120 million infections in the United States.According to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University as of 19:21 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 7 August 2021, the total COVID-19 cases in the US has crossed the 35.73 million mark, with the death toll reaching 616,712. Comparisons
Epidemics of similar size (the number is the U.S. death toll):

HIV/AIDS in the United States: 700,000 as of 2018
1918 Spanish Flu: 675,000Other large epidemics:

Stay #InTheKnow about the COVIID-19 vaccine: 1 - The Pfizer & Moderna vaccines require two doses, 3–4 weeks apart;  2 - The vaccines can’t cause COVID-19;  3 - Vaccines provide protection, but won’t prevent infection. #JTCHS #WeKnow https://t.co/OQUnaWSE58 [SEP] Initial advice indicated that vaccination required two doses given 21 days apart, but the interval was later extended to up to 42 days in the US, and up to four months in Canada.Clinical trials began in April 2020; by November 2020, the vaccine entered phase III clinical trials, with over 40,000 people participating. Distribution and storage is a logistical challenge because the vaccine needs to be stored at extremely low temperatures.In August 2022, a bivalent version of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent) was authorized for use as a booster dose in individuals twelve years of age and older in the United States. It also stated that people with "severely weakened" immune systems can receive an extra dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine starting at least 28 days after their second dose. Initially, most COVID‑19 vaccines were two-dose vaccines, with the sole exception being the single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. High efficacy is achieved with full immunization, two weeks after the second dose, and was evaluated at 94.1%: at the end of the vaccine study that led to emergency authorization in the US, there were eleven cases of COVID‑19 in the vaccine group (out of 15,181 people) versus 185 cases in the placebo group (15,170 people). It also started testing to see if a third shot of the existing vaccine could be used to fend off the virus variants.In August 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) authorized the use of an additional mRNA vaccine dose for immunocompromised individuals.In September 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started evaluating the use of a booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be given at least six months after the second dose in people aged twelve years and older.On 4 October 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that people with "severely weakened" immune systems can receive an extra dose of either the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine starting at least 28 days after their second dose.In October 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) authorized the use of either homologous or heterologous vaccine booster doses. Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended. "Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of two doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. 
  It's the norm for a death certificate to list >1 cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most common 'other causes' are conditions that can be CAUSED by severe Covid - e.g. pneumonia or respiratory failure, and chronic conditions such as diabetes that people can live with for years, until catching Covid. [SEP] Common chronic diseases include diabetes, functional gastrointestinal disorder, eczema, arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders and some viral diseases such as hepatitis C and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Some chronic conditions though, are caused by transmissible infections such as HIV/AIDS.63% of all deaths worldwide are from chronic conditions. Chronic diseases constitute a major cause of mortality, and the World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 38 million deaths a year to non-communicable diseases. Risk factors
While risk factors vary with age and gender, most of the common chronic diseases in the US are caused by dietary, lifestyle and metabolic risk factors that are also responsible for the resulting mortality. The most common chronic conditions are high blood pressure, arthritis, respiratory diseases like emphysema, and high cholesterol.Based on data from 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), about 60% of adult Americans were estimated to have one chronic illness, with about 40% having more than one; this rate appears to be mostly unchanged from 2008. The two most common chronic conditions in the elderly are high blood pressure and arthritis, with diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer also being reported among the elder population.In examining the statistics of chronic disease among the living elderly, it is also important to make note of the statistics pertaining to fatalities as a result of chronic disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death from chronic disease for adults older than 65, followed by cancer, stroke, diabetes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, and, finally, Alzheimer's disease. Though the rates of chronic disease differ by race for those living with chronic illness, the statistics for leading causes of death among elderly are nearly identical across racial/ethnic groups.Chronic illnesses cause about 70% of deaths in the US and in 2002 chronic conditions (heart disease, cancers, stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, mental illness and kidney diseases) were 6 of the top ten causes of mortality in the general US population. 
 I really can’t believe that a steroid based treatment wasn’t already used widely in Covid19 https://t.co/FYuDGMTxwJ late dad had COPD and he was on them practically 365 days for decades ! I know covid & copd arent the same but both cause breathlessness amongst other things. [SEP] COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5 million people (2.4% of the global population). Corticosteroids
Inhaled corticosteroids are anti-inflammatories that are recommended by GOLD as a first-line maintenance treatment in COPD cases with repeated exacerbations. It is essentially used in treating those with chronic bronchitis along with systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids given orally can improve lung function and shorten hospital stays but their use is recommended for only five to seven days; longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and death. Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD was published in the late 1950s. Health system responses
Australia
In October 2020, a guide published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) says that ongoing post-COVID-19 infection symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain will require management by GPs, in addition to the more severe conditions already documented.In December 2021, research by a health economics expert at Deakin University suggests that even without fully understanding the Omicron variant's effects yet, a further 10,000 to 133,000 long COVID cases are likely to emerge on top of the current approximately 9450 in New South Wales and 19,800 in Victoria, after border and other restrictions had been recently lifted.

Wearing a mask does cause disease, harm the immune system or create any healthy problems   https://t.co/wMCxAkV27U [SEP] Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended because they expel the wearer's breath outwards, and an infected wearer would transmit the virus through the valve. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. Properly worn masks are effective in both limiting the spread of the virus by an infected individual and protecting an uninfected individual from infection.The National Health Commission of China cited the following reasons for the wearing of masks by the public, including healthy individuals:

Asymptomatic transmission. Wang Linfa, an infectious disease expert who heads a joint Duke University and National University of Singapore research team, said masking is about "preventing the spread of disease rather than preventing getting the disease", remarking that the point is to cover the faces of people who are infected but do not know it, so it is imperative for everyone to wear one in public. Severity
In a perspective, Monica Gandhi, Chris Beyrer, and Eric Goosby posit that masking reduces the dose of the virus for the wearer and thus helps lower the severity of infection. Touching
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene." Efficacy
A systemic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of masks published in The BMJ in November 2021 showed that with 95% confidence, masks reduced COVID incidence by between 25% and 71%. 
Covid-19 can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus and dizziness https://t.co/V5itwb4NX4 [SEP] In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission. Neurological
Patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and dysgeusia. Hearing loss may have many different causes, but among those with tinnitus, the major cause is cochlear injury.In many cases no underlying cause is identified.Ototoxic drugs also may cause subjective tinnitus, as they may cause hearing loss, or increase the damage done by exposure to loud noise. Prevention
Prolonged exposure to loud sound or noise levels can lead to tinnitus. Due to its proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, the virus can spread and cause hearing loss, tinnitus (hearing noises that are not caused by outside sounds), and vertigo. Cogan syndrome (also Cogan's syndrome) is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent inflammation of the front of the eye (the cornea) and often fever, fatigue, and weight loss, episodes of vertigo (dizziness), tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and hearing loss. Cogan syndrome can lead to vision difficulty, hearing loss and dizziness. The hearing loss can range in severity from mild to profound and can be accompanied by tinnitus. 
#covid19 a risk for a severe case is highly linked to #obesity. And #diet #nutrition #processed foods is the main cause.  #shame does not work. Listen & learn https://t.co/HcVtMGzNBQ [SEP] Obesity is a risk factor for many chronic physical and mental illnesses. Some obesity-associated medical conditions may be the result of stress caused by medical discrimination against people who are obese, rather than the direct effects of obesity, and some may be exacerbated by the relatively poor healthcare received by people who are obese. Peter Muennig, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, has proposed that obesity-associated medical conditions may be caused "not from adiposity alone, but also from the psychological stress induced by the social stigma associated with being obese". COVID-19
A study in England found a linear increase in severe COVID-19 resulting in hospitalisation and death for those whose BMI is above 23, and a linear increase in admission to an intensive care unit across the whole BMI spectrum. A study from Mexico found that obesity alone was responsible for a 2.7 times increased risk of death from COVID-19, while comorbidities with diabetes, immunosuppression or high blood pressure increased the risk further. "The incidence of co-morbidities related to obesity and overweight: A systematic review and meta-analysis". Bariatric patients
Being overweight or obese are both rising medical problems. There is also a focus on the correlation between obesity and mortality.Overweight and obese people, including children, may find it difficult to lose weight on their own. 
   The coronavirus is related to HIV and HIV can cause seizures if there is infection in the central nervous system also sudden cardiac arrest can cause a short period of seizing. [SEP] Heart problems are more common in people with HIV/AIDS. HIV is a major cause of cardiomyopathy (problems with the heart muscle that reduce the efficiency with which the heart pumps blood). The most common type of HIV induced cardiomyopathy is dilated cardiomyopathy also known as eccentric ventricular hypertrophy which leads to impaired contraction of the ventricles due to volume overload. Encephalopathy
HIV-infected patients with encephalopathy are more likely to die of congestive heart failure than are those without encephalopathy; the hazard ratio is 3.4. However, the cause of HAD can be difficult to discern because the central nervous system can be damaged by a number of other causes related to HIV infection:
opportunistic infections
AIDS-related lymphoma or metastasis of other AIDS-related cancers
direct effects of HIV in the brain
toxic effects of drug treatments
malnutritionMany researchers believe that HIV damages the vital brain cells, neurons, indirectly. In these cases, symptoms may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion and seizures. During this period (usually days to weeks post-exposure) fifty to ninety percent of infected individuals develop an influenza or mononucleosis-like illness called acute HIV infection (or HIV prodrome), the most common symptoms of which may include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, mouth and esophageal sores, and may also include, but less commonly, headache, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, ulcers in the mouth or on the genitals, enlarged liver/spleen, weight loss, thrush, night sweats and diarrhea and neurological symptoms. AIDS-related mania is sometimes seen in patients with advanced HIV illness; it presents with more irritability and cognitive impairment and less euphoria than a manic episode associated with true bipolar disorder. 
  I just saw that FB won't allow anyone to see the vid I shared "Doctors Speak Out About This Powerful Covid Treatment".  "...information that could cause physical harm" Very annoying. Meanwhile I've begun IVM as prophylaxis. Feeling good about that.  Thank u Dr. Kory! [SEP] As of August 2021, studies reported that the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are "highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19".

[SEP] They are also referred to as cell-mediated immune (CMI) vaccines.It is thought that they can be more effective than conventional B-cell vaccines for protection from microbes that hide inside host cells, and viruses (such as HIV or influenza) that mutate rapidly.T-cell vaccines underwent clinical trials for HIV/AIDS.As of July 2012 none have been approved.As December 2020, The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab passed the FDA's emergency use authorization  and became the first FDA authorized T cell vaccine. mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for infectious agents such as influenza, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.In March 2022 Moderna announced the development of mRNA vaccines for 15 diseases: Chikungunya virus, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Dengue, Ebola virus disease, HIV, Malaria, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome, Tuberculosis and Zika. Acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines. BioNTech and Moderna in December of the same year obtained approval for their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Efficacy
The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech have efficacy rates of 90 to 95 percent. The reason for the efficacy of the new mRNA vaccines is not clear.Physician-scientist Margaret Liu stated that the efficacy of the new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could be due to the "sheer volume of resources" that went into development, or that the vaccines might be "triggering a nonspecific inflammatory response to the mRNA that could be heightening its specific immune response, given that the modified nucleoside technique reduced inflammation but hasn't eliminated it completely", and that "this may also explain the intense reactions such as aches and fevers reported in some recipients of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines".

Terminology and definitions
Overview
Long COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London. It can be difficult to determine whether an individual's set of ongoing symptoms represents a normal, prolonged convalescence, or extended 'long COVID'. One rule of thumb is that long COVID represents symptoms that have been present for longer than two months, though there is no reason to believe that this choice of cutoff is specific to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. British definition
The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) divides COVID-19 into three clinical case definitions:

acute COVID-19 for signs and symptoms during the first four weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first, and
long Covid for new or ongoing symptoms four weeks or more after the start of acute COVID-19, which is divided into the other two:
ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 for effects from four to twelve weeks after onset, and
post-COVID-19 syndrome for effects that persist 12 or more weeks after onset.NICE describes the term long COVID, which it uses "in addition to the clinical case definitions", as "commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) term Post-Covid Conditions qualifies long covid as symptoms four or more weeks after first infection. Long COVID was identified more in those cared for intensive care unit during the acute illness phase, children younger than five years, and those with complex chronic conditions. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. 
 The Covid patient “long haulers” are also very similar to some of us cancer patients. The aftermath of the disease (and for some of us C pts caused by treatment) is very similar. The brain fog, chronic fatigue, pain etc. [SEP] Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of conditions characterized by long-term, multi-system, often severe health problems persisting or appearing after the typical recovery period of COVID-19. The most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue and memory problems. It can be difficult to determine whether an individual's set of ongoing symptoms represents a normal, prolonged convalescence, or extended 'long COVID'. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.Symptoms reported by adults with long COVID include:
Fatigue, including extreme fatigue
Substantial exercise intolerance more than three months after infection; post-exertional malaise similar to that which is the hallmark of chronic fatigue syndrome
Dysautonomia / Orthostatic Intolerance / Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
Long-lasting cough
Muscle weakness and/or pain
Low-grade fever
Inability to concentrate (brain fog)
Memory lapses
Mental health problems, such as changes in mood or depression
Sleep difficulties
Headaches
Joint pain
Prickling pain (paresthesia) in hands and feet
Diarrhea
Bouts of vomiting
Loss of, or changes in, sense of smell (anosmia or parosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia)
Sore throat and or difficulties swallowing
Circulation disorders, including new onsets of diabetes and hypertension
Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Skin rash
Shortness of breath
Chest pains
Palpitations
Kidney problems (including, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease)
Changes in oral health (teeth, saliva, gums)
Tinnitus and Hearing loss
Blood clotting (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)
Erectile dysfunctionOne study of 35,000 patients with long COVID symptoms found cases clustered into four major symptom patterns:
Subphenotype 1 (cardiac and renal), representing about 34% of people was dominated by cardiac-related, kidney-related and circulation-related issues, including cardiac and circulatory conditions, renal failure, anemia and fluid and electrolyte disorders. Similarities to other syndromes
Long COVID has many symptoms in common with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and thus some people with long COVID meet ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long COVID—A Practical Guide.

From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #ApresJ20 #CovidLong [SEP] Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of conditions characterized by long-term, multi-system, often severe health problems persisting or appearing after the typical recovery period of COVID-19. Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. The most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue and memory problems. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms
Long COVID symptoms may involve multiple organs and may be severe. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. See also

 and please don't go into the hands of corona virus... it's not safe, it's injurious to your health and it's causes corona virus. [SEP] During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, awareness of the possibility of acquisition of infection on a commercial aircraft reached its zenith when on one flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, 16 of 120 people on the flight developed proven SARS from a single index case.There is very limited research done on contagious diseases on aircraft. The two most common respiratory pathogens to which air passengers are exposed are parainfluenza and influenza. There is no standardisation of air handling by aircraft, installation of HEPA filters or of hand washing by air crew, and no published information on the relative efficacy of any of these interventions in reducing the spread of infection.Air travel, like other forms of travel, radically increases the speed at which infections spread around the world, as viruses rapidly spread to large numbers of people living across the world. Human and cargo traffic greatly facilitates the spread of pathogens across the world, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations
The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends that oncologists should remain ready to adjust their clinical routines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. ESMO also recommends advising patients on infection control.The NHS in England stresses that individual patient decisions have to be made by multidisciplinary teams.

 You have a better chance of being hit with lightning then to get a blood clot from a vaccine. Actually Covid can cause a blood clot. [SEP] The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. Regulatory status
According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as of 28 March 2021, the reported number of cases of embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination is lower than the rate of such events in the general population overall. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine.

Lightning Safety Tips (provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) A very small number of people who develop blood clots have a more serious and often life-threatening condition, known as thrombotic storm (TS). Serious injuries and deaths caused by vaccines are very rare, and the idea that severe events are common has been classed as a "common misconception about immunization" by the WHO. 
  No people are developing these diseases and dieing as a result of becoming infected with Covid 19 for example people with diabetes getting Covid and dieing of renal failure or young people getting Covid and having a stroke as it causes blood clots eg. https://t.co/AMn7OnXr15 [SEP] The COVID-19 pandemic is a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. The COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia has resulted in 1,866,857 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 21,167 deaths. Background
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. The cause of death was not yet confirmed to be due to COVID-19 as of 5 April. Statistics

On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. 
    Mask wearing as recommended by the CDC does not cause hypoxia. COVID has been clearly associated with higher risk of stroke, though no question a sedentary lifestyle as well. [SEP] It has been shown that the breathing rates of patients with COVID-19 gradually increase, which in turn leads to silent hypoxia. It has also been shown that COVID-19 patients experience lesser levels of shortness of breath after exercise than non-COVID-19 patients.In healthy people this presentation can occur when the person breathes a gas which has a low oxygen content, and also a low carbon dioxide content, so there is no hypercapnic alarm response. Cases of silent hypoxia with COVID-19 have been reported for patients who did not experience shortness of breath or coughing until their oxygen levels had depressed to such a degree that they were at risk of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and organ failure. Prognosis
The prognosis for silent hypoxia in COVID-19 is generally poor, as oxygen levels in the blood can drop below 50 percent without being noticed. Epidemiology
Known to be associated with:

Altitude sickness
Atypical pneumonia
COVID-19
Inert gas asphyxiation
Occupational accidents involving asphyxiant environments
Rebreather malfunctions

== References == The wearing of non-medical face masks in public to lessen the transmission of COVID-19 in the United States was first recommended by the CDC on April 3, 2020, as supplemental to hygiene and appropriate social distancing. The data originated from a "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" published by the CDC, which contained a survey on behaviors exhibited by COVID patients and a control group of those who tested negative: While around 70% of both groups surveyed did say they always wore a mask, the COVID-positive patients were more likely to have engaged in close contact and activities "where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain" within the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, such as visiting a bar or restaurant. Normally, exposure to hypoxia is negatively associated to physiological changes to the body, such as altitude sickness. 
 Covid is no joke, this is why we need the vaccine. We know that mRNA doesn't cause long term effects since it decomposes in your body within 1-2 hours. Please everyone, get vaccinated as soon as you can! [SEP] mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for infectious agents such as influenza, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.In March 2022 Moderna announced the development of mRNA vaccines for 15 diseases: Chikungunya virus, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Dengue, Ebola virus disease, HIV, Malaria, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome, Tuberculosis and Zika. Acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines. Moderna designed their mRNA-1273 vaccine for COVID-19 in 2 days. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic required faster production capability of mRNA vaccines, made them attractive to national health organisations, and led to debate about the type of initial authorization mRNA vaccines should get (including emergency use authorization or expanded access authorization) after the eight-week period of post-final human trials. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue.

Limited data are available on the safety of the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine during pregnancy. Studies in animals found no safety concerns and clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines in pregnant women. History
Original version
In January 2020, Moderna announced development of an RNA vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1273, to induce immunity to SARS-CoV-2.Moderna received US$955 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), an office of the US Department of Health and Human Services. As of April 2023, only the bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) version of the vaccine is authorized in the US.On 23 December 2020, the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine was authorized by Health Canada.On 5 January 2021, the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine was authorized for use in Israel by its Ministry of Health.On 3 February 2021, the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine was authorized for use in Singapore by its Health Sciences Authority.On 30 April 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted emergency use listing.On 5 May 2021, the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use in the Philippines by the Philippines Food and Drug Administration.In 2020, Moderna partnered with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).

 6 women out of +6M given. We won't know for a long time their medical history. The problem is that the disease for the vaccine can cause blood clots. So the immune reaction, in extremely rare cases, is blood clots. I still think the vaccine is better than COVID. [SEP] The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. Regulatory status
According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as of 28 March 2021, the reported number of cases of embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination is lower than the rate of such events in the general population overall. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective, it prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded.

Early reports of the events of concern seemed to indicate the presentation rate for the specific blood clots of concern might be higher for women of younger ages, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found examples across all genders and ages, their data skewing towards these specific blood clots being more prevalent in AZD1222 vaccinated persons of younger ages.The WHO has continued to stress the administration of vaccines is based on risk versus benefit analysis. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". "Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: what we know and do not know". 
 As you can still get covid when vaccinated, it is uncertain whether the vaccine will protect against long covid. Only time will tell on this one. Even a mild case of infection can cause long covid. [SEP] COVID-19
An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. Preliminary research indicates that influenza vaccination does not prevent COVID-19, but may reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. While research has been ongoing to evaluate the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV 2 transmission, neither the CDC nor the FDA stipulate that vaccines must stop transmission of a virus, both stating that a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to produce immunity to an infectious agent. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. Effectiveness
Duration of immunity
As of 2021, available evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals and those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least six months. Vaccine adjustments
Effectiveness against transmission
As of 2022, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can transmit infection in household settings. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. 
   This whole vaccine thing is nuts. This vaccine has the potential to cause huge issues whereas catching it and recovery is less of a health risk. Plus the medications that work well to fight covid but no..let’s push this vaccine mandate. Good luck to those that get it. [SEP] The organizers, including medical professionals, charged between $10 and $17 for each dose, and more than 2,600 people paid to receive the vaccine.Interpol issued a global alert in December 2020 to law enforcement agencies in its member countries to be on the lookout for organized crime networks targeting COVID-19 vaccines, physically and online. The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. In March 2021, 19% of US adults claimed to have been vaccinated while 50% announced plans to get vaccinated.A 2022 study found a link between online COVID-19 misinformation and early vaccine hesitancy and refusal. We've lost so many people to COVID. In November 2021, Austria announced that it would introduce a nationwide vaccine mandate.In the United States, many businesses, schools and universities, healthcare providers, and governmental and state departments have enacted vaccine mandates. Effects
There is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are a very safe and effective way to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.When increased production of vaccines was urgently needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the World Trade Organization and governments around the world evaluated whether to waive intellectual property rights and patents on COVID-19 vaccines, which would "eliminate all potential barriers to the timely access of affordable COVID-19 medical products, including vaccines and medicines, and scale up the manufacturing and supply of essential medical products". Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. 
The fact that we haven't found myocarditis with CMR in the hearts of asymptomatic, otherwise healthy athletes Doesn't mean that a *symptomatic* Long Covid patient cannot have myopericarditis  As seen w/ vaccine side effects in the young, just the S-protein by itself can cause it [SEP] Recent study from Israel conludes that natural covid-19-infection is not associated with myocarditis. Bacteria can also result in myocarditis, although it is rare in patients with normal heart function and without a preexisting immunodeficiency. Myocarditis can be a rare side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. When looking at different causes of myocarditis, viral infection is the most prevalent, especially in children; however, the prevalence rate of myocarditis is often underestimated as the condition is easily overlooked and is sometimes asymptomatic. If one tests positive for an acute viral infection, clinical developments have discovered that 1-5% of said population may show some form of myocarditis.In regard to the population affected, myocarditis is more common in pregnant women, children, and those who are immunocompromised. Myocarditis and COVID-19
Myocarditis can be seen during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; with the myocarditis being associated with a spectrum of severities from asymptomatic to fulminant. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

The initial CA$82-billion aid package was announced on March 18, 2020 by Justin Trudeau.The first measures were implemented when the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act received royal assent from Governor General Julie Payette on March 25, 2020. Gas Tax Fund: Infrastructure Canada, announced on 1 June 2020, allocates $2.2 billion to help Canadian communities. As a consequence, some provincial governments (including Ontario and British Columbia) experienced a dramatic surge in revenue. References

  They have known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem.   Why haven’t they paused those, too? https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] The clinical trial is ongoing and is set to conclude in late 2022.Pregnant and breastfeeding women were also excluded from the initial trials used to obtain the emergency use authorization, though trials in those populations were expected to be performed in 2021.On 16 March 2021, in order to increase the span of vaccination beyond adults, Moderna started the clinical trials of vaccines on children age 6-months to 11-years-old in the US and in Canada (KidCove),
in addition to the existing and fully-enrolled study on 12-17 year-olds (TeenCOVE). Paused vaccinations
Out of concern that the vaccine may increase the risk of myocarditis in young people under age 30, Finland, Sweden, Germany, and France recommended Moderna vaccinations not be used for this age group in October/November 2021. "On 7 July 2020, disputes between Moderna and government scientists over the company's unwillingness to share data from the clinical trials were revealed.Moderna also faced criticism for failing to recruit people of color in clinical trials.On 18 August 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a plan to offer a booster dose eight months after the second dose, citing evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease and the possibility of reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. "How Moderna's Vaccine Works". The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised on 9 December 2020 that people who have a history of "significant" allergic reaction should not receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine. Since April 2021, increasing number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States in about 13 per 1 million young people, mostly male and over the age of 16, after vaccination with the Pfizer–BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine. Brazil was also restricted from donating or receiving donations of vaccines.In July 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review designation for the biologics license application (BLA) for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with a goal date for the decision in January 2022. It also stated that people with "severely weakened" immune systems can receive an extra dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine starting at least 28 days after their second dose. 
  CoVID 19 is known to create blood clotting & thickening. Your kidneys are a filter for your blood so when this happens your blood literally clogs your kidneys and causes kidney failure.  Many CoVID patients are on renal meds or dialysis. I am so sorry for your loss! This is real! [SEP] Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia.Causes of acute kidney failure include low blood pressure, blockage of the urinary tract, certain medications, muscle breakdown, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed uraemia.Symptoms of kidney failure include the following:
High levels of urea in the blood, which can result in:
Vomiting or diarrhea (or both) that may lead to dehydration
Nausea
Weight loss
Nocturnal urination (nocturia)
More frequent urination, or in greater amounts than usual, with pale urine
Less frequent urination, or in smaller amounts than usual, with dark coloured urine
Blood in the urine
Pressure, or difficulty urinating
Unusual amounts of urination, usually in large quantities
A buildup of phosphates in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out may cause:
Itching
Bone damage
Nonunion in broken bones
Muscle cramps (caused by low levels of calcium which can be associated with hyperphosphatemia)
A buildup of potassium in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out (called hyperkalemia) may cause:
Abnormal heart rhythms
Muscle paralysis
Failure of kidneys to remove excess fluid may cause:
Swelling of the hands, legs, ankles, feet, or face
Shortness of breath due to extra fluid on the lungs (may also be caused by anemia)
Polycystic kidney disease, which causes large, fluid-filled cysts on the kidneys and sometimes the liver, can cause:
Pain in the back or side
Healthy kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin that stimulates the bone marrow to make oxygen-carrying red blood cells. People with acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the crush syndrome, when large amounts of toxins are suddenly released in the blood circulation after a long compressed limb is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing ischemia. The resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys. Chronic kidney disease results in worse all-cause mortality (the overall death rate) which increases as kidney function decreases. The leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5.While kidney replacement therapies can maintain people indefinitely and prolong life, the quality of life is negatively affected. Renal cortical necrosis (RCN) is a rare cause of acute kidney failure. Grossly, the kidneys may show patchy or diffuse renal cortical necrosis. 
  1.) They take away the most important part of our communication: mimic and body language in general. 2.) The humid, warm environment behind the masks can cause bacterial pneumonia, which in turn can lead to Corona disease. 1/2 [SEP] For a masked person, or even one sneezing or coughing into a tissue or elbow, these distances are reduced.Masking any person who may be a source of infectious droplets (or aerosols) thus reduces the unsafe range of physical distances. Handwashing removes infectious droplets that their mask caught (from either side) and which transferred to their hands when they touched their mask.For pathogens transmitted through the air, strategies to block cough air jets and to capture aerosols, e.g. Cloth face masks can be used for source control but are not considered personal protective equipment as they have low filter efficiency (generally varying between 2–60%), although they are easy to obtain and reusable after washing. Health care personnel and patients with COVID-19 symptoms are recommended to use surgical masks if available, as they are more protective. Masking patients reduces the personal protective equipment recommended by CDC for health care personnel under crisis shortage conditions.The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recommend face masks in non-healthcare community settings in severe epidemic situations with a high prevalence of asymptomatic but infectious persons, especially when visiting crowded indoor spaces such as grocery stores, public transportation, and for certain workers who must  come into physical proximity with many other people. The double protection the face mask portrays, the “inward” protection and the “outward” protection, make the face mask another tool that if it is well developed according to the flow physics of sneezing, coughing, and the SARS-Cov-2 particles’ behaviour can play a significant role in mitigating the virus. Masks or face coverings are worn to reduce the virus breathed out by an infected person (who may not know they are infected), as well as the virus breathed in by a susceptible person. Wearing masks in indoor spaces reduces the risk of transmission, however it is recommended to evacuate the location immediately where an act of sneeze occurred. 
 I'm not trying to make comparisons, I'm trying to point out that saying the vaccine can cause serious side effects is a bit hypocritical coming from a guy who's been trivialising covid all year when many of us have had long term illness from that. I wasn't trying to cause offence [SEP] Walensky actually said in a press briefing that vaccinated and unvaccinated people could have "similarly high" viral loads when infected with the delta variant, but did not say that vaccinated people had a higher viral loads or were "super-spreaders". A frequent fallacy consisted in concluding on the ineffectiveness (or low effectiveness) of vaccines after noticing the apparently high proportion of vaccinated patients among COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths, without taking into account the high proportion of vaccinated people among the general population, thus committing the base rate fallacy; or without taking into account the tendency of people at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 to be vaccinated in priority, thus ignoring the Yule–Simpson effect.In the United Kingdom, a report from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), published in March 2021, predicted that 60% of hospitalisations and 70% of deaths would be among people who had received two doses of the vaccine, despite the latter remaining highly effective. A 2021 study published in the British Medical Journal suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 200 times more likely to cause blood clots in patients than the AstraZeneca vaccine. In the case of the latter, the plaintiffs claimed that the mandate applied specifically to Comirnaty only, and not the "experimental" Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.Another claim was that the approved version does not share the same liability protection as the version produced under an EUA. It did not literally state that the vaccines are operating systems, and therefore proponents of this claim are committing the reification fallacy. Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. In a situation with herd immunity to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.The non-specific effects should not be confused with the side effects of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases anaphylaxis). The retrospective updating method can lead to a considerable bias in vaccine studies, biasing observed mortality rate ratios towards zero (a large effect), whereas the landmark method leads to a non-specific misclassification and biases the mortality rate ratio towards unity(no effect). 
Fighting stigma —  Covid-19 Impact On Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Market 2020, SWOT Analysis, New ...: Alzheimer's disease is a condition most common in people of 65 years or above age. This disease causes confusing reactions like the confusion ... https://t.co/sFZNcRossl [SEP] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. In the United States in 2020, Alzheimer's dementia prevalence was estimated to be 5.3% for those in the 60–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 13.8% in the 74–84 group and to 34.6% in those greater than 85. With some jobs, a mistake may have devastating consequences on a large number of people, and cases have been reported in which a person with early-onset Alzheimer's who is unaware of their condition has caused distress.Younger people with Alzheimer's may also lose their ability to take care of their own needs, such as money management.It has been suggested that conceptualizations of Alzheimer's and ageing should resist the notion that there are two distinct conditions. Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disease and it is the leading cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging, which occurs both sporadically (the most common form of diagnosis) or due to familial passed mutations in genes associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Common symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease include: memory loss, confusion, and mood changes.As Alzheimer's disease affects around 55 million patients globally and accounts for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases, billions of dollars are spent yearly towards research to better understand the biological mechanisms of the disease as well as develop effective therapeutic treatments for it. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by two hallmarks: senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangle. Alzheimers Dement.

Maybe mRNA vaccines caused rare heart inflammation in some teens. "The CDC hasn’t determined if there’s really a link to the shots, and continues to urge that everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against Covid-19, which is far riskier than the vaccine." https://t.co/RH3rquGcMV [SEP] They are also referred to as cell-mediated immune (CMI) vaccines.It is thought that they can be more effective than conventional B-cell vaccines for protection from microbes that hide inside host cells, and viruses (such as HIV or influenza) that mutate rapidly.T-cell vaccines underwent clinical trials for HIV/AIDS.As of July 2012 none have been approved.As December 2020, The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab passed the FDA's emergency use authorization  and became the first FDA authorized T cell vaccine. On October 24, 2011, the military services began administering the new adenovirus vaccine to recruits during basic training.The vaccine is orally administered and consists of live (not attenuated) virus. Adenovirus Vaccines at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Vaxart COVID-19 vaccine is a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Vaxart. EuCorVac-19 is a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by EuBiologics Co.

EuBiologics Co., Ltd started the study on February 23, 2021. Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. In Sweden, individuals who recently got chemotherapy were found to be at a higher risk for developing severe illness following COVID-19. The possibility has been raised, but needs to be investigated further, that patients with long COVID-19  may be predisposed to the development of lung cancer.

For others, the embarrassment factor may be overarching, especially when at a disadvantaged socioeconomic situation, for example one who needs financial assistance to obtain medical help. In these scenarios the embarrassment may be duplicated due to a possible scenario wherein they are to be examined by both a doctor and perhaps if underage, a parent, or if an adult of low socioeconomic circumstances, perhaps a social worker.

The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/0PhwEKpCBR [SEP] Their jobs demanded constant awareness and vigilance, reduced their autonomy, reduced access to social support, reduced self-care, uncertainty about the effects of long-term exposure to COVID-19 patients, and fear of infecting others.In some jurisdictions, schools were closed during the early months of the pandemic. Feeling pressure is normal in a crisis. COVID-19 has affected social structures across cultures, and for people living with PTSD, global measures that regulate the body by means of school closures, border restrictions, social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing, expose the ‘population to feelings of intense fear and helplessness’. Healthcare workers
Before COVID-19, healthcare workers already faced many stressors, including health risks, the possibility of infecting their household, and the stress of working with extremely sick patients. COVID-19's physical and emotional burden impacted healthcare workers increased rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout that impacted sleep, quality work/empathy towards patients, and suicide rates.Cases of anxiety and depression within healthcare workers who interact with COVID-19 patients increased by 1.57% and 1.52% respectively.One study reported that frontline nurses experience higher rates of anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.A cross-sectional study using an online survey in Southern California examined stress levels before and during the pandemic. The experiment concluded that nurses reported feeling moderate and high levels of stress compared to before the pandemic.A five-part questionnaire conducted among healthcare workers in Ghana to examine the correlation between COVID-19 and mental health. It suggested that psychological distress indices significantly correlated with items relating to COVID-19. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. 
 I received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and had side effects with a fever. That side effect is also cause to self isolate and get a Covid test as per the screening tool and Health Links.  What should people having vaccine side effects do? [SEP] However, adverse effects may occur at the site of injection, such as mild redness and swelling, as well as rare systemic reactions such as fever, sore throat, headache and malaise. She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". Adverse effects
The most common side effects in the clinical trials were usually mild or moderate and got better within a few days after vaccination.Vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, swelling, redness at the injection site and low levels of blood platelets occurred in less than 1 in 10 people. Enlarged lymph nodes, decreased appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, abdominal pain, itching and rash occurred in less than 1 in 100 people.An increased risk of the rare and potentially fatal thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been associated with mainly younger female recipients of the vaccine. Analysis of VigiBase reported embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, found a temporally related incidence of 0.21 cases per 1 million vaccinated-days.Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are known side effects of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has assessed 41 cases of anaphylaxis from around 5 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom.Capillary leak syndrome is a possible side effect of the vaccine.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) listed Guillain-Barré syndrome as a very rare side effect of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and added a warning in the product information.Additional side effects include tinnitus (persistent ringing in the ears), paraesthesia (unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation), and hypoaesthesia (decreased feeling or sensitivity, especially in the skin). The first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 94% for COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28–34 days post-vaccination. Symptoms often include a rash, joint pain, fever, and lymphadenopathy. 
some insight, covid-19 is the name of the disease, not the virus. the virus' name is SARS-CoV 2. just like how HIV is the name of the virus that causes AIDS, and rubeola the virus that causes the measles :D [SEP] There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A similar structure has also been used by the AP when referring to virus variants, for example, referring to it as the "Delta variant" rather than the "South African variant".On 11 February 2020, the WHO named the disease COVID-19 (short for coronavirus disease 2019). WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus, and D stands for disease, while 19 stands for the year that the outbreak was first detected. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names.On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as "the COVID-19 virus" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. "Coronavirus (Covid-19)". "Covid-19: Novel Coronavirus Outbreak". 
  It actually is worse than the corona virus that causes the common cold. https://t.co/nlukW9crPA [SEP] Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections normally mild, such as the common cold (caused by human coronaviruses in ~15% of cases), cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). Common cold
Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus. The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19. 
   Lots of things can cause heart failure. Could be hereditary.  Could be stress, diet or all of the above. There is no conclusive evidence that COVID alone causes heart failure in healthy people. [SEP] Other conditions that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy. : 3612  Heart failure is the potential end stage of all heart diseases.Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. : e279 : Table 5  In addition, viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. If more than one cause is present, progression is more likely and prognosis is worse.Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab and substance use disorders of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Pathophysiology
Heart failure is caused by any condition that reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life. Non-genetic cardiomyopathies can have a definitive causes such as viral infections, myocarditis and others.Cardiomyopathies are either confined to the heart or are part of a generalized systemic disorder, both often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability. 
   The vast majority had conditions such as respiratory failure, blood clots and stroke, which can be caused by the coronavirus itself.

      Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Info from Mayo Clinic [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. About 35% of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 experience neurological complications. Neurological symptoms are not unique to COVID-19; infection with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also give rise to acute and delayed neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. COVID-19 does not appear to elicit epilepsy de novo in children, but it can bring out seizures in children with prior histories of epilepsy. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. 
When delhi govt solve the problem of mosquito in delhi full night we not able to sleep and it's also cause malaria pls see on this matter also either one side is corona and second side is malaria infection pls help [SEP] Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Prevention
Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. Mosquito control
Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. Modifications to people's houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure. ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.In areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done:

Patients in coma should be given meticulous nursing care ( monitor vital signs, turn patient every 2 hours, avoid lying the patient in a wet bed etc.) Research directions
Epidemiological and entomological surveillance and research on the interconnection between malaria transmission and population movement requires attention, as to is improvement in living facilities to prevent forced movement of people, awareness of the connection between mosquitoes and malaria, in addition to adequate healthcare and the control of urbanization.Airport malaria poses a potential risk to the local spread of malaria. 
   Incidentally, the 400k Of Covid deaths are phony too!!! The fact is 1/2 of those at least were actually caused by something else (diabetes, heart diseases, etc.) as there was/still is insurance insensitives; BIG $ to code as Covid. Here’s a unique example; one month the Covid~ [SEP] The CDC estimates that, between February 2020 and September 2021, only 1 in 1.3 COVID-19 deaths were attributed to COVID-19. The true COVID-19 death toll in the United States would therefore be higher than official reports, as modeled by a paper published in The Lancet Regional Health – Americas. From March 1, 2020, through the end of 2020, there were 522,368 excess deaths in the United States, or 22.9% more deaths than would have been expected in that time period.In February 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, a shortage of tests made it impossible to confirm all possible COVID-19 cases and resulting deaths, so the early numbers were likely undercounts.The following numbers are based on CDC data, which is incomplete. Measuring case and mortality rates
In early 2020, deaths from all causes exceeded the seasonal average, and data from early 2020 suggest additional deaths that were not counted in official reported coronavirus mortality statistics. By April 25, the U.S. had more than 905,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 52,000 deaths, giving it a mortality rate around 5.7 percent. The American Academy of Pediatrics's weekly report from when states started reporting to September 17, 2020, tracked 587,948 child COVID-19 cases, 5,016 child hospitalizations, and 109 child deaths.Epidemiologists depend on accurate reporting of cases and deaths to advise government response, and some have questioned the reliability of the numbers of confirmed cases. At the time of the publication of the study, Anand announced that researchers would monitor the study participants for months to help determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation tactics.As of May 2021, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that there had been approximately 120 million infections in the United States.According to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University as of 19:21 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 7 August 2021, the total COVID-19 cases in the US has crossed the 35.73 million mark, with the death toll reaching 616,712. Comparisons
Epidemics of similar size (the number is the U.S. death toll):

HIV/AIDS in the United States: 700,000 as of 2018
1918 Spanish Flu: 675,000Other large epidemics:

1957–1958 influenza pandemic: 116,000
1968 Hong Kong flu: 100,000

 I want to know why long covid can get immediate recognition and treatment....an infection that can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Just like PANS and PANDAS! Yet, PANS PANDAS families are being hurled into the pits of neglect by your dangerous consensus statement [SEP] Since PANS encompasses a broader group than PANDAS, children may be more likely to be labeled with PANS and receive testing and treatments promoted for PANDAS that lack scientific support. Diagnosis
Neither PANDAS nor PANS are listed as a diagnosis in the 2013 fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) or confirmed as distinct disorders. Studies of experimental treatments for PANS and PANDAS (IVIG, TPE, antibiotics, tonsillectomy, corticosteroids and NSAIDs) are "few and in general have moderate or high risk of bias", according to a Sigra et al review published in 2018, which states: Nevertheless, there are 3 recent papers proposing guidelines for how to treat PANDAS and PANS using psychiatric and behavioral interventions (Thienemann et al., 2017), immunomodulatory therapies (Frankovich et al., 2017) and antibiotics (Cooperstock et al., 2017). A 2019 review by Wilbur et al said that evidence for treatment of children with PANDAS/PANS is lacking, and remission rates in symptoms after treatment "may represent the natural history of [non-PANDAS pediatric OCD] cases rather than true treatment effect". Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of conditions characterized by long-term, multi-system, often severe health problems persisting or appearing after the typical recovery period of COVID-19. Terminology and definitions
Overview
Long COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London. Long COVID was identified more in those cared for intensive care unit during the acute illness phase, children younger than five years, and those with complex chronic conditions. A review of what is known about long COVID by the NIHR
Long-COVID treatments: why the world is still waiting, Heidi Ledford, Nature News Feature, 9 August 2022 
Some of the severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 seem to result from the activity of specific immune cells, which can cause long-term inflammation of the lungs. [SEP] The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms
Long COVID symptoms may involve multiple organs and may be severe. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, influenza, and pharyngitis to life-threatening diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis, acute asthma, lung cancer, and severe acute respiratory syndromes, such as COVID-19. This inflammation can lead to airway obstruction. This causes chronic respiratory infections, cough, and nasal congestion. Further lung damage occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. 
  Interesting thing about Covid is that it can cause pneumonia, where as pneumonia doesn't cause Covid. [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause. Some viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia. The severity of the condition is variable.Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also result in pneumonia. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia. 
Why was handcock pumping this into Covid patients![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Midazolam injection may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems such as shallow, slowed, or temporarily stopped breathing that may lead to permanent brain injury or death? [SEP] At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A "midazolam infusion syndrome" may result from high doses, is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed.In rare susceptible individuals, midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. In healthy humans, 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.Although the incidence of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Overdose
A midazolam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.Symptoms of midazolam overdose can include:

Detection in body fluids
Concentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be measured in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. 
Apparently COVID can cause hair loss...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So that’s cool... [SEP] It is also called "ophiasis inversus".This form of hair loss "...targets the body's own hair follicles, resulting in hair loss..." and although the immune system could be attacking hair follicle melanocytes, dermal papilla cells, and keratinocytes,” the foundational cause of this disease is yet to be confirmed. It is the most common cause of hair loss. Interleukin 1 is suspected to be a cytokine mediator that promotes hair loss.The fact that hair loss is cumulative with age while androgen levels fall as well as the fact that finasteride does not reverse advanced stages of androgenetic alopecia remains a mystery, but possible explanations are higher conversion of testosterone to DHT locally with age as higher levels of 5-alpha reductase are noted in balding scalp, and higher levels of DNA damage in the dermal papilla as well as senescence of the dermal papilla due to androgen receptor activation and environmental stress. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory    suggests that dermal fibrosis is associated with the progressive hair-loss and hair-whitening in old people. Whether sleep deprivation can cause hair loss by some other mechanism is not clear. There is typically little inflammation and irritation, but hair loss is significant. Complications
Patients with hair loss are at risk for psychological conditions such as increased anxiety and depression. Autoimmune causes of hair loss may put patients at risk for other autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and vitiligo. 
#Neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia increase the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and dying from the disease. For people with Alzheimer's the risk is three times greater. It can be six times greater if they are over 80 https://t.co/sxQ21lyfhu #science [SEP] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical, or economic aspects. The dementia death rate is increasing, resulting in the shift from fourth to second leading cause of death from 2006 to 2015. In 2017, dementia and Alzheimer's disease was responsible for 13,729 deaths. Approximately 20% of all dementia deaths occurred in people aged 75–84 and 70% in those 85 years of age and over. Dementia mostly affects the elderly with approximately 95% of all dementia deaths occurring after the age of 74. Aging is a major risk factor for most common neurodegenerative diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lou Gehrig's disease. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Within neurodegenerative diseases, it is estimated that 55 million people worldwide had dementia in 2019, and that by 2050 this figure will increase to 139 million people. 
 There are studies that address that. Look up Fibromyalgia & MD in Newton, Ma. I don't go along w/his tx regimen, but he championed that, 'of course chronic illness can CAUSE depression/anxiety' & had been proven(some classic Minnesota study).Also, HCPs doubting your sick contribs [SEP] Some obesity-associated medical conditions may be the result of stress caused by medical discrimination against people who are obese, rather than the direct effects of obesity, and some may be exacerbated by the relatively poor healthcare received by people who are obese. Peter Muennig, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, has proposed that obesity-associated medical conditions may be caused "not from adiposity alone, but also from the psychological stress induced by the social stigma associated with being obese". Psychiatric
Depression
Obesity has been associated with depression, likely due to social factors rather than physical effects of obesity. However, it is possible that obesity is caused by depression (due to reduced physical activity or, in some people, increases in appetite). Repeated failed attempts at weight loss might also lead to depression.The association between obesity and depression is strongest in those who are more severely obese, those who are younger, and in women. Chronic lung disease
Obesity is associated with a number of chronic lung diseases, including asthma and COPD. His clinical research trials focused on the treatment of chronic depression, initially with antidepressant medications and, more recently, with psychotherapy. Jason's interest in chronic fatigue syndrome began when he was diagnosed with the condition in 1990 after having mononucleosis. 
     There's a really fact based answer for that. And the covid vaccine trials started in April 2020. So it's been over a year. And mRNA vaccines can't cause autoimmune diseases (although they may be dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases.) [SEP] Following the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on 18 March 2021, vaccinations commenced on 22 March 2021, and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating 70% of the population by late October 2021. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Background
Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years – and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. A study is investigating the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 provided by the mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. A variety of intranasal COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. For example, Chinese vaccine developers and the government Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began their efforts in January 2020, and by March were pursuing numerous candidates on short timelines.The rapid development and urgency of producing a vaccine for the COVID‑19 pandemic was expected to increase the risks and failure rate of delivering a safe, effective vaccine. 
  That's not true at all. Overlooking the fact that western medicine tends to treat symptoms not causes, the Covid vaccine, like all vaccines, work by helping your body identify the virus & create antibodies to protect you from infection. Your comments do nothing but spread fear. [SEP] mRNA vaccines are not vaccines
Financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur David Martin claimed that mRNA vaccines do not fit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definitions of a vaccine because they do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. While research has been ongoing to evaluate the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV 2 transmission, neither the CDC nor the FDA stipulate that vaccines must stop transmission of a virus, both stating that a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to produce immunity to an infectious agent. Cancer
The website Natural News has published claims that mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 can cause cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressing proteins. Vaccines as an "operating system"
Beginning in 2021, misinformation started circulating on the Internet claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines are actually "operating systems". Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. FALSE: Vaccines cause harmful side effects and even death: Vaccines are very safe. FALSE: The COVID-19 vaccines contain injectable microchips to identify and track people: This conspiracy theory started circulating in 2020 claiming the COVID-19 pandemic was a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, was behind it. 
There are hints that pple who have serious COVID-19 mount the strongest responses, just as in the 2 other serious human diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe  SARS & MERS Both trigger high antibody levels that last up to 2 years, & T cell responses to SARS can be detected even [SEP] There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Notably, both the Alpha and the Delta variants were observed to be more transmissible than previously identified viral strains.Some SARS-CoV-2 variants are considered to be of concern as they maintain (or even increase) their replication fitness in the face of rising population immunity, either by infection recovery or via vaccination. Long COVID-19
Even though many COVID-19 patients recover within 2–6 weeks of the onset of symptoms, some develop symptoms that come and go for months. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus.COVID-19 rapid antigen tests are lateral flow immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which indicates current viral infection. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of a vaccine that provides long-lasting immunity against infection from COVID-19, it will be impossible to eradicate the disease.The severity of a disease in an endemic phase depends on how long-lasting immunity against severe outcomes is. 
 You literally missed the point of everything I said. Mild infections will not cause long term lung damage. That’s it. Infections, viral or otherwise, causing vasculitis and thrombosis, is nothing new. Only thing new is greater % of severe infections with Covid19. [SEP] Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs. Further damage to the lungs occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. Viral pneumonia is more prevalent in the very young, less than 5 years old, and in the very old, more than 75 years old. Causes of acute alveolar lung disease include pulmonary edema (cardiogenic or neurogenic), pneumonia (bacterial or viral), systemic lupus erythematosus, bleeding in the lungs (e.g., Goodpasture syndrome), idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Further lung damage occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection, including bacterial pneumonia. Bacteria may travel from the lung to the bloodstream, causing septic shock (very low blood pressure which damages the brain, kidney, and heart). The data showed that particulate matter can be a major cause of cardiovascular disease, and can also cause pulmonary toxicity. 
The ignorant and misinformed people on this thread!! Let’s tell our 18 year olds not to get a vaccine because of side effects, leaving them open to getting a disease which can potentially cause long Covid and problems for months after! Great parenting there!! 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/6FR5dTPFOg [SEP] This misinformation has proliferated and may have made many people averse to vaccination. Officials also stated that people with "uncontrolled severe chronic diseases" should not receive the SinoVac vaccine and urged those who weren't sure to consult with their doctors first. In March 2021, 19% of US adults claimed to have been vaccinated while 50% announced plans to get vaccinated.A 2022 study found a link between online COVID-19 misinformation and early vaccine hesitancy and refusal. FALSE: Vaccines cause harmful side effects and even death: Vaccines are very safe. In 2020, as COVID-19 numbers rose and vaccinations started to roll out, the misinformation around vaccines causing infertility began to circulate. A 2021 study found that misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media "induced a decline in intent [to vaccinate] of 6.2 percentage points in the [United Kingdom] and 6.4 percentage points in the [United States] among those who said they would definitely accept a vaccine".Social media is again the leading platform for the rapid spreading of vaccine misinformation during a pandemic. The live, weakened vaccine is generally not recommended in pregnant women, children less than two years old, adults older than 50, or people with a weakened immune system. These requirements occasionally engender union lawsuits on narrow collective bargaining grounds, but proponents note that courts have generally endorsed forced vaccination laws affecting the general population during disease outbreaks.Vaccination against influenza is especially considered important for members of high-risk groups who would be likely to have complications from influenza, for example pregnant women and children and teenagers from six months to 18 years of age who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
In raising the upper age limit to 18 years, the aim is to reduce both the time children and parents lose from visits to pediatricians and missing school and the need for antibiotics for complications
An added benefit expected from the vaccination of children is a reduction in the number of influenza cases among parents and other household members, and of possible spread to the general community.The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States.Furthermore, the CDC recommends that health care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons receive injections (TIV or QIV) rather than LAIV. 
We may see a flood of patients with memory loss or even #Alzheimers in a few years; #COVID19 can cause major problems in the brain that look similar to #TBI or #Alzheimers disease.  https://t.co/fhtlPKk9yg [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Neurological symptoms are not unique to COVID-19; infection with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV also give rise to acute and delayed neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In the United States alone the number of people affected by dementia is striking at 3.8 million.While studies show that there are “normal” aspects to aging, such as graying hair and changes in vision, there are changes such as forgetting how to do things that are not considered “normal”. In 2050, there could be a pandemic of neurological diseases. 
‘Covid infection can cause liver damage’ https://t.co/bbxcfViujg [SEP] Viral hepatitis is liver inflammation due to a viral infection. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. (Elevated levels indicate liver cells are being damaged by the virus or other disease). Chronic hepatitis C, an infection with the hepatitis C virus, causes inflammation of the liver and a variable grade of damage to the organ. Over several decades, this inflammation and damage can lead to cirrhosis. This leads to  liver damage. This causes inflammation and eventually scarring as well as cirrhosis. The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that over time lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
#EU #covid #brexit  disagreements re covid vaccines could cause more damage within the Eu than brexit did [SEP] A dispute broke out in January 2021 between the European Commission and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca AB about the provision of COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, in February, spilled out into a dispute over Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. In the past, the European Union member states had decided on their own health policies, but during the summer of 2020, Brussels therefore took charge of vaccine procurement in what Ursula von der Leyen called a "European Health Union". The British Medical Journal reported that the effects of the row over safety were likely to cause a long-lasting reduction in the willingness of people living in the EU to take the vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic and its spread in Europe has had significant effects on some major EU members countries and on European Union institutions, especially in the areas of finance, civil liberties, and relations between member states. He compared the impact of coronavirus to World War I.

Coronabonds controversy
The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated that "If we don't propose now a unified, powerful and effective response to this economic crisis, not only the impact will be tougher, but its effects will last longer and we will be putting at risk the entire European project", while the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte commented that "the whole European project risks losing its raison d'être in the eyes of our own citizens".Debates over how to respond to the epidemic and its economic fallout have opened up a rift between Northern and Southern European member states, reminiscent of debates over the 2010s European debt crisis. Vaccines
In July 2020 the European Union refused an offer of 500 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech due to its pricing.In January 2021, the EU changed their mind and bought 300 million BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine doses and considered buying 300 million more. Problems with delivery thereof led to the European Commission–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine dispute.On 1 December 2021, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU nations should consider making COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory because too many people were refusing to get shots voluntarily. The study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. 
Yo, why would a vaccine that creates spike proteins smooth muscle contractions cause the kidney to start releasing large amounts of blood clotting compounds in susceptible people? Must be the adenovirus. https://t.co/AvxlcaEDFv  oh https://t.co/A1S4YrLGcP https://t.co/rq8kOxTWhP [SEP] An adenovirus vaccine is a vaccine against adenovirus infection.It was used by the United States military from 1971 to 1999, but was discontinued when the only manufacturer stopped production. This vaccine elicited immunity to adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7, the serotypes most often associated with acute respiratory disease. On March 16, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an adenovirus vaccine manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals under contract to the U.S. Army. This vaccine is essentially the same as the one used from 1971 to 1999. On October 24, 2011, the military services began administering the new adenovirus vaccine to recruits during basic training.The vaccine is orally administered and consists of live (not attenuated) virus. The tablets are coated, so that the virus passes the stomach and infects the intestines, where the immune response is raised.It should not be confused with the strategy of using adenovirus as a viral vector to develop vaccines for other pathogens, or as a general gene carrier.

Based on few articles, that comparison is incorrect, because covid causes clots in the brain (Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: CVST), while birth control pills cause clots in the legs that travel to the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism) & those are treatable with anticoagulants. [SEP] Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is more common in particular situations. The inflammatory response and prolonged immobilization of patients with COVID-19 may also help explain the formation of CVST.It is possible for the clot to break off and migrate (embolise) to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. Treatment
Various studies have investigated the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Clinical trials in the 1990s finally resolved the concern about using anticoagulants in most cases of CVST. Various risk factors increase the likelihood of any one individual developing a thrombosis:

Risk factors
Acquired
Inherited
Mixed
The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared to 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; Compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep vein thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. Examples are:
Anticoagulants (such as warfarin or heparin) and antiplatelet medication (such as aspirin, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel) can prevent new clots from forming
Thrombolytics (such as streptokinase) can dissolve clots
Painkillers given intravenously
Vasodilators to relax and dilate blood vessels.Appropriate drug treatments successfully produce thrombolysis and removal of the clot in 50% to 80% of all cases.Antithrombotic agents may be administered directly onto the clot in the vessel using a flexible catheter (intra-arterial thrombolysis). 
 Yeah. & I don’t think they don’t have a Covid vaccine for babies yet so I definitely wouldn’t put it in my body while pregnant. Cause you really don’t even know they effect it’s gonna have on you either. I got mine the other day tho. No side effects except for a sore arm. [SEP] Immunization during pregnancy is the administration of a vaccine to a pregnant individual. In many countries, including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand, vaccination against influenza, COVID-19 and whooping cough is routinely offered during pregnancy. However, certain vaccines are contra-indicated in pregnancy. However, the original smallpox vaccination was never widely used during pregnancy because, as a live vaccine, its use is contraindicated. COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy
COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. Before COVID-19 vaccines were available, pregnant women who caught the disease were at increased risk of needing intensive care, invasive ventilation or ECMO, but not at increased risk of death. Infection significantly increased the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and pre-eclampsia.COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and associated with improved levels of risk for stillbirth, premature birth and admission of the newborn to intensive care. Vaccination can prevent COVID-19 infection during pregnancy although these immunity benefits are not passed on to the child.mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were first rolled out in December 2020. 
   Sorry but I’m slapping this down really hard. Too much mis info out there as it is. Covid-19 vaccine does NOT cause shingles. It is caused by leftover measles viruses in your body. It’s a very small possibility getting the Covid-19 vaccine can trigger the shingles. [SEP] A study including children with leukaemia found that the risk of getting shingles after vaccination is much lower than the risk of getting shingles for children with natural chicken pox in their history. During an outbreak of shingles, exposure to the varicella virus found in shingles blisters can cause chickenpox in someone who has not yet had chickenpox, although that person will not suffer from shingles, at least on the first infection. The short- and long-term pain caused by shingles outbreaks originates from inflammation of affected nerves due to the widespread growth of the virus in those areas.As with chickenpox and other forms of alpha-herpesvirus infection, direct contact with an active rash can spread the virus to a person who lacks immunity to it. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Doctors say that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, than getting the disease, which can be fatal or lead to shingles later in life. "The risk of shingles is significantly lower among children who have received varicella vaccination, including those who are immunocompromised. As there is an increased risk of shingles in adults due to possible lack of contact with chickenpox-infected children providing a natural boosting to immunity, and the fact that chickenpox is usually a mild illness, the National Health Service cites concerns about unvaccinated children catching chickenpox as adults when it is more dangerous. A few people may develop a mild rash, which usually appears around the injection site.There is a short-term risk of developing herpes zoster (shingles) following vaccination. 
   The cytokines released in severe COVID can cross the BBB & cause inflammation. The “happy hypoxia” has neuro implications. The cytokine storm can also cause clots. Again, the mechanism of cell entry is identical to SARS 1. And I can’t find any info that SARS 1 did this. [SEP] Normally, cytokines are part of the body's immune response to infection, but their sudden release in large quantities can cause multisystem organ failure and death.Cytokine storms can be caused by a number of infectious and non-infectious etiologies, especially viral respiratory infections such as H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus. The viruses can invade lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to produce viral nucleic acid, which stimulates the infected cells to release cytokines and chemokines, activating macrophages, dendritic cells, and others.Cytokine storm syndrome is a diverse set of conditions that can result in a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm syndromes include familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Epstein-Barr virus–associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic or non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis–associated macrophage activation syndrome, NLRC4 macrophage activation syndrome, cytokine release syndrome and sepsis. Relationship to COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors have attributed many deaths to cytokine storms. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune system resulting in a release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6, which can increase vascular permeability and cause a migration of fluid and blood cells into the alveoli leading to such consequent symptoms as dyspnea and respiratory failure. A cytokine plasma level analysis showed that in cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the levels of many interleukins and cytokines are highly elevated, indicating evidence of a cytokine storm. In vivo models have demonstrated NSG (NOD/SCID/γ-chain deficient mice) with defects of both lymphocyte and myeloid lineage compartments do not develop CRS after CAR-T cell infusion.In addition to adoptive T-cell therapies, severe CRS or cytokine reactions can occur in a number of infectious and non-infectious diseases including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, Ebola, avian influenza, smallpox, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sufficiently cleared by the early acute phase anti-viral response in most individuals, some progress to a hyperinflammatory condition, often with life-threatening pulmonary involvement. 
 Same with me and my siblings, but in our case it's long term illnesseses that cause compromised immune systems, in fact my brother is on immune suppressants due to a rare auto immune disease, so for us the risks of COVID are far worse than potential side effects of the vaccine. [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. Long COVID-19
Even though many COVID-19 patients recover within 2–6 weeks of the onset of symptoms, some develop symptoms that come and go for months. A T-cell vaccine is a vaccine designed to induce protective T-cells.T-cell vaccines are designed to induce cellular immunity. They are also referred to as cell-mediated immune (CMI) vaccines.It is thought that they can be more effective than conventional B-cell vaccines for protection from microbes that hide inside host cells, and viruses (such as HIV or influenza) that mutate rapidly.T-cell vaccines underwent clinical trials for HIV/AIDS.As of July 2012 none have been approved.As December 2020, The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab passed the FDA's emergency use authorization  and became the first FDA authorized T cell vaccine. Smallpox vaccine should not be given to patients with a history of eczema. Because of the danger of transmission of vaccinia, it also should not be given to people in close contact with anyone who has active eczema and who has not been vaccinated. People with other skin diseases (such as atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, or herpes zoster) also have an increased risk of contracting eczema vaccinatum and should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Recent cases
In March 2007, a two-year-old Indiana boy and his mother contracted the life-threatening vaccinia infection from his father who was vaccinated against smallpox as part of the standard vaccination protocol for individuals serving in the US armed forces beginning in 2002. 
   A mortality rate under 1% from a vaccine is still a stunning success. Of course people may die from it, but those cases are far and few between and a much lesser toll than untreated covid will cause. The scales aren’t even close to equal. [SEP] The influenza vaccine is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.Since 2004, clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been slowly coming in: 2,058 people were vaccinated in October and November 2005. Although the overall fatality rate for the Spanish flu is estimated to have been 10% to 20% of the population, the lethal waves of the Spanish flu are not reported to have emerged with anything like the over-50% case fatality ratio observed to date in human H5N1 infection. If a human pandemic does not emerge in the next few years, its eventual emergence may become almost a non-event if a very-effective pre-pandemic vaccine has prepared the population with sufficient herd immunity to blunt its lethality. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.The vaccine has non specific effects such as preventing respiratory infections, that may be greater than those of measles prevention alone. Background
In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year. With 100% immunization, and 100% efficacy of the vaccines, one out of seven deaths among young children could be prevented, mostly in developing countries, making this an important global health issue. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus.The Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing illness and deaths from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines.Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. The CDC estimates that, between February 2020 and September 2021, only 1 in 1.3 COVID-19 deaths were attributed to COVID-19. 
 Thanks for linking this and telling some of your story. 💜 I've dealt with chronic illness most of my adult life. My biggest worry about COVID-19, and not just for myself, is the long-term effects it's going to cause. Few people understand how drastically it can change your life. [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. Healthcare and COVID-19
One of the social impacts of COVID-19 is its influence on healthcare. With the start of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers struggled to keep up with an increase in demands, a reduced capacity, increased stress and workload, and to lack of protective equipment.COVID-19 changed the perception of patient care for providers. Elderly care
Older people are particularly affected by COVID-19. They need special attention during the COVID-19 crisis, and their voices, opinions and concerns are important in formulating responses.Global data are extremely uncertain at present, nonetheless, the heightened risks of COVID-19 for older persons are evident in all national data. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted long-term care facilities and nursing homes around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has had far-reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it, including political, cultural, and social implications. 
The virus seems to cause two kinds of lung disease + blood disease. Young people are having strokes. Young people who had light cases may be developing new syndromes of dangerous illness. #COVID is the Swiss army knife of viruses, can & will do anything to anybody. https://t.co/Nj7UA6jvma [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, new lineages often differ from one another by just a few nucleotides.Some of the potential consequences of emerging variants are the following:
Increased transmissibility
Increased morbidity
Increased mortality
Ability to evade detection by diagnostic tests
Decreased susceptibility to antiviral drugs (if and when such drugs are available)
Decreased susceptibility to neutralising antibodies, either therapeutic (e.g., convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) or in laboratory experiments
Ability to evade natural immunity (e.g., causing reinfections)
Ability to infect vaccinated individuals
Increased risk of particular conditions such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome or long COVID. Cross-species transmission
There is a risk that COVID-19 could transfer from humans to other animal populations and could combine with other animal viruses to create yet more variants that are dangerous to humans. As with many other crises, the COVID-19 pandemic may compound existing vulnerabilities and inequalities experienced by children. Children risk losing caregivers to COVID-19. Children and adolescents may also experience mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic itself, such as increased anxiety, as they might fear that they or their loved ones will get infected or they might worry about the future of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. 
 There are are over 1000 Covid cases in East Lansing.  The virus can cause cardiac inflammation. Anyone else think this is just a really stupid idea? [SEP] The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. state of Michigan were discovered on March 10, 2020, one day before the outbreak of the disease was officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. As of December 20, 2022, 2,977,727 cases have been identified, causing 40,657 deaths.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services made the COVID-19 vaccines available to all residents age 16 years and older on April 5, 2021, in accordance with President Joe Biden's order directing all states to do so by April 19, 2021. Statewide, almost 4,100 people were hospitalized with COVID-19. April 20: A report by the research group Covid Act Now finds Michigan is the only state categorized as at a "severe" risk level for a virus outbreak. September 2021
September 22: The state surpasses one million confirmed cases of COVID-19. December 2021
During the first week of December, COVID-19 hospitalizations in Michigan reached an all-time high. February 2022
On February 4, Michigan surpassed two million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Two more cases of it were found there five days later.As of January 23, six people had been discovered to be infected with the new UK variant of COVID-19, one in Wayne County and five in Washtenaw County who have ties to the University of Michigan, causing its sports teams to shut down activities for two weeks.As of January 27, 14 people in Washtenaw County had tested positive for the UK variant of COVID-19.By February 4, 28 people in the state had tested positive for the UK variant of COVID-19, all of them in either Washtenaw or Wayne counties.On February 7, Kent County reported its first positive test for the UK variant of COVID-19. 
    No, with a virus that causes heart, lung, kidney & brain damage, strokes & heart failure are known to be caused by #COVID19.  It’s also expected to cause more cases of dementia long term. Now go get a vaccine! https://t.co/Egd4G45E0Q [SEP] Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. COVID-19 has not been associated with strokes in children. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
 They are both are Coronaviruses that are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections. Rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak can be lethal. [SEP] Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past:
Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), β-CoV
Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), β-CoV
Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), α-CoV
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), α-CoV–Three human coronaviruses produce potentially severe symptoms:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2003)
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2012)
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), β-CoV (identified in 2019)These cause the diseases commonly called SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 respectively. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the first identified strain of the SARS coronavirus species, severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1; or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV) is a strain of coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the respiratory illness responsible for the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. 
    If you get vaccinated you can fight of infection as if you get normal cold. As your immune already knows the threat the effect of virus will be mild. In case you dont get vaccine..your immune takes time to identify virus(covid turns to pneumonia fast) which may cause serious prob [SEP] Annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.There is no vaccine for the common cold. Signs and symptoms
The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. Other
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Prevention
The best prevention against viral pneumonia is vaccination against influenza, chickenpox (varicella zoster), herpes zoster, measles, respiratory syncytial virus vaccine (RSV), rubella, and adenovirus vaccine. Besides vaccination there are no other ways to prevent viral pneumonia besides basic hygiene skills like covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, staying home when sick, and washing your hands frequently. 
 Covid19 contains 4 spike proteins found in hiv. The cause of Covid 19 is from the twins that were genetically altered to be immune to hiv.  They contracted a coronavirus that exploited their resistance to hiv, and mutated to covid19 [SEP] Spike (S) glycoprotein (sometimes also called spike protein, formerly known as E2) is the largest of the four major structural proteins found in coronaviruses. Antibodies against spike glycoprotein are found in patients recovered from SARS and COVID-19. Due to the outbreak of SARS and the COVID-19 pandemic, antibodies to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have been extensively studied. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have been identified that target epitopes on the receptor-binding domain or interfere with the process of conformational change. Building on techniques previously used in vaccine research aimed at respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV, many SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts have used constructs that include mutations to stabilize the spike protein's pre-fusion conformation, facilitating development of antibodies against epitopes exposed in this conformation.According to a study published in January 2023, markedly elevated levels of full-length spike protein unbound by antibodies were found in people who developed postvaccine myocarditis (vs. controls that remained healthy). Monoclonal antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein have been developed as COVID-19 treatments. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes suggests that some sites in the spike protein sequence, particularly in the receptor-binding domain, are of evolutionary importance and are undergoing positive selection.Spike protein mutations raise concern because they may affect infectivity or transmissibility, or facilitate immune escape. Mutations
Variants of SARS-CoV-2
As well as having eight mutations (four of these synonymous genetic mutations) in its open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) – one of which is a set of deletions – Gamma has 10 defining mutations in its spike protein, including N501Y and E484K. 
Peripheral neuropathy hurts, I know firsthand via a motor-sensory stroke.  The CoVID vaccine DOES cause the fingers to ache -- my weakest finger aches now; it was the thumb a week ago.  But it's NOTHING like the CPSP pain, at all!   It's a sore pain (how I notice the difference). [SEP] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is neuropathic pain that occurs due to damage to a peripheral nerve caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster, also known as shingles). Several types of pain may occur with PHN including continuous burning pain, episodes of severe shooting or electric-like pain, and a heightened sensitivity to gentle touch which would not otherwise cause pain or to painful stimuli. Abnormal sensations and itching may also occur.The nerve pain of PHN is thought to result from damage in a peripheral nerve that was affected by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus or troubles after chemotherapy. Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a nerve-damaging side effect of antineoplastic agents in the common cancer treatment, chemotherapy. CIPN involves various symptoms such as tingling, pain, and numbness in the hands and feet. The term "peripheral neuropathy" sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking.

             Misunderstanding of nicotine is profoundly bad.  A recent Rutgers U. study found 80% of US doctors think it causes cancer.  It does not.  Nicotine MAY reduce #COVID19 risks; DEFINITELY reduces Parkinson's disease risk 30-60%; MAY reduce Alzheimer's; DEFINITELY reduces weight... [SEP] Smoking has been found to contribute to dementia and cognitive decline, reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescents, and brain shrinkage (cerebral atrophy).Most notably, some studies have found that patients with Alzheimer's disease are more likely not to have smoked than the general population, which has been interpreted to suggest that smoking offers some protection against Alzheimer's. Researchers without tobacco lobby influence have concluded the complete opposite: Smokers are almost twice as likely as nonsmokers to develop Alzheimer's disease.Former and current smokers have a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease compared to people who have never smoked, although the authors stated that it was more likely that the movement disorders which are part of Parkinson's disease prevented people from being able to smoke than that smoking itself was protective. Another study considered a possible role of nicotine in reducing Parkinson's risk: nicotine stimulates the dopaminergic system of the brain, which is damaged in Parkinson's disease, while other compounds in tobacco smoke inhibit MAO-B, an enzyme which produces oxidative radicals by breaking down dopamine.In many respects, nicotine acts on the nervous system in a similar way to caffeine. Unlike some recreational drugs, nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's motor skills, judgement, or language abilities while under the influence of the drug. Systematic review of reports that suggested smokers respond better to treatment for ischemic stroke provided no support for such claims.Claims of surprising benefits of smoking, based on observational data, have also been made for Parkinson's disease, as well as a variety of other conditions, including basal-cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, acute mountain sickness, pemphigus, celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis, among others.Tobacco smoke has many bioactive substances, including nicotine, that are capable of exerting a variety of systemic effects. A data-driven hypothesis that long-term administration of very low doses of nicotine (for example, in an ordinary diet) might provide a degree of neurological protection against Parkinson's disease remains open as a potential preventive strategy. In the same year, a case–control study first suggested a possible protective role in Parkinson's disease.Historical claims of possible benefits in schizophrenia, whereby smoking was thought to ameliorate cognitive symptoms, are not supported by current evidence. The carcinogenity of tobacco smoke is not explained by nicotine per se, which is not carcinogenic or mutagenic, although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are. 
 The FDA has known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem. Why haven’t they paused those, too?  https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] Paused vaccinations
Out of concern that the vaccine may increase the risk of myocarditis in young people under age 30, Finland, Sweden, Germany, and France recommended Moderna vaccinations not be used for this age group in October/November 2021. "On 7 July 2020, disputes between Moderna and government scientists over the company's unwillingness to share data from the clinical trials were revealed.Moderna also faced criticism for failing to recruit people of color in clinical trials.On 18 August 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a plan to offer a booster dose eight months after the second dose, citing evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease and the possibility of reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. "How Moderna's Vaccine Works". The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020, and mass vaccinations began four days later. The Moderna vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on December 17, 2020, and the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on February 27, 2021. Pfizer had adequate stocks available and began this distribution on December 17, 2020, but the federal government reduced the amount Pfizer was allowed to distribute.On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. However, this vaccine has faced backlash from some government officials, believing it to be not as effective as Pfizer or Moderna. On March 5, the mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, rejected a shipment of the Janssen vaccine, saying, "Moderna and Pfizer are the best. 
  Steady on.  Covid (particularly the new strain) does cause pneumonia... [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause. Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever, non-productive cough, runny nose, and systemic symptoms (e.g. Some viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia. Being pregnant can also affect the chances of developing viral pneumonia. Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection, including bacterial pneumonia. 
   So basically we never have to wear sunblock again because UV rays kill the virus. Of course those same rays can cause skin cancer, but at least no Corona right? SMH Don't forget to drink some bleach tonight.  gets my vote [SEP] Sunscreen, also known as sunblock or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer. The routine use of sunscreens may also reduce the risk of melanoma. However, many sunscreens do not block ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, yet protection from UVA is important for the prevention of skin cancer.To provide a better indication of their ability to protect against skin cancer and other diseases associated with UVA radiation (such as phytophotodermatitis), the use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreens has been recommended. Health effects
Benefits
Sunscreen use can help prevent melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two types of skin cancer. A study on 32 subjects showed that daily use of sunscreen (SPF 30) reversed photoaging of the skin within 12 weeks and the amelioration continued until the end of the investigation period of one year. Sunscreen is inherently anti-ageing as the sun is the number one cause of premature ageing, it therefore may slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles, dark spots and sagging skin. Sunblock
Sunblock typically refers to opaque sunscreen that is effective at blocking both UVA and UVB rays and uses a heavy carrier oil to resist being washed off. Since sunscreen's active ingredients work preventatively by creating a shielding film on the skin that absorbs, scatters, and reflects light before it can reach the skin, UV filters have been deemed an ideal “first line of defense” against sun damage when exposure can't be avoided. 
Diet, exercise, and other interventions, you can radically reduce your risk of COVID-19. The focus of my COVID-19 prevention method is on strengthening immune function through stress and anxiety reduction. Chronic stress cause inflammation which has a profound impact on diseases [SEP] Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity is associated with decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of heart failure, and improved overall survival. Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Regular exercise can help improve your cardiovascular health, reduce stress and anxiety, and strengthen your muscles and bones. Weight loss decreases these risks. Avoid negative coping strategies, such as avoidance of crowds and pandemic news coverage. Anxiety and depression
An increase of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic is a commonly held perception worldwide. However, that greater emotion regulation (measured pre-pandemic) was associated with lower acute stress (measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) in response to the early pandemic in the US during lockdown. Studies have shown that academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular physical exercise.There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of exercise performed from approximately 700–2000 kcal of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly men. 
 It's just so ignorant and stupid to insist the covid-19 vaccine will cause people to be  magnetic.  It's just so ridiculous It's pitiful. [SEP] Magnetization
Some social media users have falsely asserted COVID-19 vaccines cause people to become magnetized such that metal objects stick to their bodies. Video clips of people showing magnets sticking to the injection site have been spread on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, claiming that vaccination implants a microchip in people's arms. No COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. or Europe contain magnetic or metal ingredients or microchips. Another study showed that a predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories was negatively correlated to the intention of individuals to get vaccinated.Spreading vaccine misinformation can lead to financial rewards by posting on social media and asking for donations or fundraising for anti-vaccination causes. A 2021 study found that misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media "induced a decline in intent [to vaccinate] of 6.2 percentage points in the [United Kingdom] and 6.4 percentage points in the [United States] among those who said they would definitely accept a vaccine".Social media is again the leading platform for the rapid spreading of vaccine misinformation during a pandemic. It is useful to pair scientific evidence with stories that connect to the belief and value system of the audience.While social media companies have taken recent steps to reduce the presence of vaccine misinformation on their platforms, misinformed users and their social groups remain. People are likely to filter any new information they receive to fit their preexisting worldview – corrective vaccine facts are no exception to this motivated reasoning. The authors attribute this result to a potential danger priming effect – when pushed into a fearful state, parents misattribute this fear to the vaccine itself, rather than the diseases it prevents. 
There’s no evidence that the new #vaccine against COVID-19 cause infertility, yet that’s a worry that’s been cited by some has a reason they’re reluctant to be first in line to get the shots. #covid #infertility https://t.co/NlB1y0WWWw [SEP] Safety concerns
While some anti-vaccinationists openly deny the improvements vaccination has made to public health or believe in conspiracy theories, it is much more common to cite concerns about safety. As with any medical treatment, there is a potential for vaccines to cause serious complications, such as severe allergic reactions, but unlike most other medical interventions, vaccines are given to healthy people and so a higher standard of safety is demanded. While serious complications from vaccinations are possible, they are extremely rare and much less common than similar risks from the diseases they prevent. The resulting controversy has caused many parents to delay or avoid immunizing their children. Based on studies in animal models, theoretical concerns have been raised about a possible link between schizophrenia and maternal immune response activated by virus antigens; a 2009 review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of trivalent influenza vaccine during the first trimester of pregnancy, but that the vaccine was still recommended outside the first trimester and in special circumstances such as pandemics or in women with certain other conditions. There have been a number of reasons expressed why people might not wish to take COVID-19 vaccines, such as concerns over safety, self-perception of being "low risk", or questioning the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in particular. COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant people are not necessarily anti-vaccine.Soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, preexisting anti-vaxxer social networks started online and in-person campaigns to discredit the developing COVID-19 vaccines targeting United States citizens. Reasons
The reasons for hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccine are complex and vary between individuals, including concerns about side effects of the vaccination, wanting to wait to see if the vaccine is safe, and believing misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines promulgated by conspiracy theories, including but not limited to incorrect beliefs that vaccines contain microchips from Bill Gates to track and control people, intentional side effects, infertility, and permanent genetic alteration. 
     a person who had high blood pressure or diabetes out it is still the Covid19 that killed them. They would be contributing caused not the primary one.[NEWLINE]And yes, if a person had  Covid but  had a diabetic coma and died you would likely say that the diabetic coma was the primary [SEP] Diabetic coma is a life-threatening but reversible form of coma found in people with diabetes mellitus.Three different types of diabetic coma are identified:
Severe low blood sugar in a diabetic person
Diabetic ketoacidosis (usually type 1) advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of a severely increased blood sugar level, dehydration and shock, and exhaustion
Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (usually type 2) in which an extremely high blood sugar level and dehydration alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.In most medical contexts, the term diabetic coma refers to the diagnostical dilemma posed when a physician is confronted with an unconscious patient about whom nothing is known except that they have diabetes. Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19, are more common and severe among individuals with poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetics have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and higher rates of high blood pressure. Secondary diabetes When a person gets diabetes because of another disease or because of taking certain drugs or chemicals. These complications are also a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.The primary complications of diabetes due to damage in small blood vessels include damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Of these two prediabetic states, the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular disease. kidney failure), which often lead to premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes. 
   No.  The Mrna vaccines don't use the live virus that causes covid-19.  The astrazeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus as a delivery system.  This  "vector" virus does not cause covid - 19. [SEP] Medical uses
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Pharmacology
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine containing a modified, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1, containing the full‐length codon‐optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence. Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca COVID‐19 Vaccine, and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca are manufactured by AstraZeneca. An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. Acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines. These antigens and viruses are prepared and grown outside the body.In contrast, mRNA vaccines introduce a short-lived synthetically created fragment of the RNA sequence of a virus into the individual being vaccinated. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue. "Understanding mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines". 
DO NOT RECEIVE SATAN'S VACCINES[NEWLINE]VACCINES FORBIDDEN by THE CREATOR[NEWLINE]VACCINES do NOT PREVENT Covid19 infection or transmission of the virus.[NEWLINE]VACCINES cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects. [NEWLINE]VACCINES contain harmful ingredients. [NEWLINE]VACCINES MADE FOR PROFIT not MEDICAL REASONS https://t.co/qTFslcm7MY [SEP] mRNA vaccines are not vaccines
Financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur David Martin claimed that mRNA vaccines do not fit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definitions of a vaccine because they do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. While research has been ongoing to evaluate the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV 2 transmission, neither the CDC nor the FDA stipulate that vaccines must stop transmission of a virus, both stating that a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to produce immunity to an infectious agent. Vaccines as an "operating system"
Beginning in 2021, misinformation started circulating on the Internet claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines are actually "operating systems". No COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. or Europe contain magnetic or metal ingredients or microchips. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". Arguments against vaccination are contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.Founder Brandy Vaughan died in December 2020; no replacement executive director has been named. The message used on the billboards claimed vaccines kill children, portraying specific cases even though there was no evidence supporting the claims. Although a small fraction of vaccine doses provoke serious adverse reactions, health professionals agree the benefits of being protected against a wide range of infectious diseases far outweigh the risks. 
There is something I don't get - why does an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer's cause breathing problems?  Those with COVID-19 have such problems presumably because the virus is attacking the lungs. But the mRNA vaccines don't contain any viruses. [SEP] An mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. To minimize this, mRNA sequences in mRNA vaccines are designed to mimic those produced by host cells.Strong but transient reactogenic effects were reported in trials of novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccines; most people will not experience severe side effects which include fever and fatigue. The reason for the efficacy of the new mRNA vaccines is not clear.Physician-scientist Margaret Liu stated that the efficacy of the new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could be due to the "sheer volume of resources" that went into development, or that the vaccines might be "triggering a nonspecific inflammatory response to the mRNA that could be heightening its specific immune response, given that the modified nucleoside technique reduced inflammation but hasn't eliminated it completely", and that "this may also explain the intense reactions such as aches and fevers reported in some recipients of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines". "Understanding mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines". In 2020 and 2021, mRNA vaccines have been developed globally for use in combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19 pandemic). The Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was the first mRNA vaccine approved by a medicines regulator, followed by the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and others. mRNA vaccines
Several COVID‑19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, use RNA to stimulate an immune response. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.RNA vaccines are the first COVID‑19 vaccines to be authorized in the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. 
 Typical example where covid19 is not a flu threat, but rather attacks the brain and causes major brain dysfunction. [SEP] Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural function, leading to illness and complications, many of which frequently are neurological in nature, such as impaired motor skills and altered behavior. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. About 35% of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 experience neurological complications. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. 
   If the vaccine hasn't been around that long, how do they know it can cause Alzheimer's. It doesn't suddenly come in a rush! 🤦‍♀️ I do know people who've had Covid - they had a worse reaction to the AZ vaccine but only 24-48 hours. Covid symptoms were awful and more than a month.

"Alzheimer's Disease Research Timeline – Alzforum". Reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, are very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.The vaccine is the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use and the first cleared for regular use. Distribution and storage is a logistical challenge because the vaccine needs to be stored at extremely low temperatures.In August 2022, a bivalent version of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent) was authorized for use as a booster dose in individuals twelve years of age and older in the United States. History
Before COVID‑19 vaccines, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never before been produced in less than several years, and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans. On 23 August 2021, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged sixteen years and older.The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine was authorized in Canada on 16 September 2021, for people aged twelve and older.In July 2022, the FDA approved the vaccine for use for those aged twelve years and older.In September 2022, the CHMP of the EMA recommended converting the conditional marketing authorizations of the vaccine into standard marketing authorizations. An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting 2–4 weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years.The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. These symptoms begin from one to four days after exposure to the virus (typically two days) and last for about 2–8 days. 
    As far as being run over by a truck, yes it is possible that someone trying to beat a truck when crossing a road collapses and gets struck down.  Cause lungs collapsed from damage caused by Covid, totally possible. Cardiac  arrest is one of many symptoms of covid. [SEP] Although associated injuries are often the cause of death, pulmonary contusion is thought to cause death directly in a quarter to half of cases. About 70% of cases result from motor vehicle collisions, most often when the chest strikes the inside of the car. However, it is known that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Consolidation and collapse
Pulmonary contusion can cause parts of the lung to consolidate, alveoli to collapse, and atelectasis (partial or total lung collapse) to occur. Reduced production of surfactant can also occur in surrounding tissue that was not originally injured.Inflammation of the lungs, which can result when components of blood enter the tissue due to contusion, can also cause parts of the lung to collapse. Complications
Pulmonary contusion can result in respiratory failure—about half of such cases occur within a few hours of the initial trauma. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. Usually, deaths of people with pulmonary contusion result from other injuries, commonly traumatic brain injury. 
 Precisely. It’s what I’ve said. Me being a young adult COVID does not affect me that much. A common flu is more severe for me, this vaccine we don’t know the long term health risks. The first vaccine caused blood clots, Who know what else these new one can cause [SEP] Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". The reasoning is because in the 20-29 age range the benefits to individual of vaccination were less as their likelihood of harm from COVID‑19 is less and closer to the potential risk of harm from the vaccine (at a medium exposure risk with COVID‑19 infection cases running at a rate of 60 per 100,000). The advice is "based on the increasing risk of severe outcomes from COVID‑19 in older adults (and hence a higher benefit from vaccination) and a potentially increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following AstraZeneca vaccination in those under 50 years." The effectiveness of flu vaccines is considered to be suboptimal, particularly among the elderly, but vaccination is still beneficial in reducing the mortality rate and hospitalization rate due to influenza as well as duration of hospitalization. Reviews of case–control studies found effects against laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia, and death among the community-dwelling elderly.The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine.A flu vaccine containing an adjuvant was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015, for use by adults aged 65 years of age and older. In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. "Summary of the NACI literature review on the comparative effectiveness of subunit and split virus inactivated influenza vaccines in older adults". 
  ...so a vaccine trialed in a study from the early 2000s can cause a liver inflammatory response in ferrets. But so can Covid-19, along with inflammation of most major organ systems. [SEP] A number of studies have demonstrated adverse reactions in pets after administering vaccines to both dogs and cats. Controversy
In recent years, vaccination has become a controversial topic among veterinarians and pet owners. Possible causes
Vaccine-specific
Adverse reactions usually occur because of a harmful immune-mediated reaction to either the vaccine immunogen itself or to the vaccine adjuvants, which are designed to boost the immune response to the vaccines. Animal-specific
In addition to vaccine-specific factors, vets and owners should also consider pet-specific factors that have been shown to increase the risk of adverse reactions in both dogs and cats. See also

#COVID19 IS NOT A COLD Soooo If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, understand that this can happen: “#coronavirus could be acting like herpes, which causes cold sores & in rare cases, brain swelling AKA #encephalitis. That swelling triggers the immune system.“ https://t.co/dw3WQZCbmr [SEP] Viral encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma, called encephalitis, by a virus. Many encephalitic viruses often have characteristic symptoms of infection, helping to aid diagnosis. Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural cell function, including causing fluid buildup in the brain, vascular congestion, and bleeding. Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis is usually accompanied by enlargement of the lymph nodes and enlargement of the spleen
Herpes zoster encephalitis may be accompanied by rash and skin vesicles, and because it involves the frontal lobe and temporal lobe, is often characterized by psychiatric features, memory deficits, and loss of language faculties. 'brain'; and the medical suffix -itis, "inflammation"), also known as herpes meningoencephalitis, is a medical condition that simultaneously resembles both meningitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the meninges, and encephalitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the brain tissue. Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis includes evaluation for the presence of recurrent or recent herpes infection, fever, headache, altered mental status, convulsions, disturbance of consciousness, and focal signs. There is evidence that aberrant inflammation triggered by herpes simplex can result in granulomatous inflammation in the brain, which responds to steroids. Other viruses can cause similar symptoms of encephalitis, though usually milder (Herpesvirus 6, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, etc.). 
 An organization that doesn't use statistics to guide policy is inept. 6 vaccine injuries out of 7 million doses administered. One in a million odds. Versus what are the odds of injury from covid? Less than one in a million? An over abundance of caution can cause harm. [SEP] Medical claims
Claims of inefficacy
Recurrent claims, based on misinterpretation of statistical data, have been made regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. A frequent fallacy consisted in concluding on the ineffectiveness (or low effectiveness) of vaccines after noticing the apparently high proportion of vaccinated patients among COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths, without taking into account the high proportion of vaccinated people among the general population, thus committing the base rate fallacy; or without taking into account the tendency of people at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 to be vaccinated in priority, thus ignoring the Yule–Simpson effect.In the United Kingdom, a report from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), published in March 2021, predicted that 60% of hospitalisations and 70% of deaths would be among people who had received two doses of the vaccine, despite the latter remaining highly effective. Vaccines as a cause of death
United States
Claims have been made that data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveals a hidden toll of COVID-19 vaccine related deaths. As Omicron subvariants spread across the city, a study showed that 15% of those aged 80 or older who weren't immunized at all died after contracting the disease, compared with 3% of those who got two SinoVac shots and 1.5% of those who received two BioNTech doses. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof. Chris Whitty, tweeted in September 2021 that "The majority of our hospitalised Covid patients are unvaccinated and regret delaying their vaccines" with about 60% of all hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in the UK being of unvaccinated individuals. Undercounting of COVID-19 pandemic deaths has been witnessed around the world. Undercounting can cause a number of problems such as delay in vaccines to priority populations.Lack of resources with regard to testing, differences in how COVID-19 cases and deaths are counted, and other inefficiencies in data collection and updation largely explain this undercounting. Low testing may result in a high death rates, causing overestimates in mortality related modelling.In May 2022, the WHO report stated that there were 14.9 million deaths worldwide due to COVID-19 by the end of 2021, a figure that is 3 times higher than the official estimate of 5.4 million deaths. 
   It looks like covid causes neurological damage hence the array of symptoms. So supplements like B12 and magnesium may help. Also histamine seems to be high in some long haulers so reducing this can have benefit, by avoiding high histamine foods [SEP] The most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue and memory problems. Many other symptoms have also been reported, including malaise, headaches, shortness of breath, anosmia (loss of smell), parosmia (distorted smell), ageusia (distortion or loss of taste), muscle weakness, low-grade fever, and cognitive dysfunction.Estimates of the prevalence of long COVID vary based on definition, population studied, time period studied, and methodology, generally ranging between 5% and 50%. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.Symptoms reported by adults with long COVID include:
Fatigue, including extreme fatigue
Substantial exercise intolerance more than three months after infection; post-exertional malaise similar to that which is the hallmark of chronic fatigue syndrome
Dysautonomia / Orthostatic Intolerance / Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

Subphenotype 1 (cardiac and renal), representing about 34% of people was dominated by cardiac-related, kidney-related and circulation-related issues, including cardiac and circulatory conditions, renal failure, anemia and fluid and electrolyte disorders. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

  Doesn't matter. Covid can cause existing comorbidities to worsen. Covid can also CAUSE comorbidities, such as pneumonia, heart attack, clotting, kidney disease, etc. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/v4dkIEeqXH [SEP] Chronic effects of COVID-19 can lead to a prolonged inflammatory state, which can increase symptoms resembling an autoimmune disorder. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Complications: Nosologies having pathogenetic relation to the primary disease, supporting the adverse progression of the disorder, causing acute worsening of the patient's conditions (are a part of the complicated comorbidity). Comorbidity affects life prognosis and increases the chances of fatality. Considering the link between nutrition and chronic disease discussed above, underlying disease itself has been associated with greater COVID-19 disease burden. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect.   https://t.co/aTtdgb6xWf [SEP] In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission. Overview
Some less common symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; however the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and loss of taste and smell. Loss of smell
In about 60% of COVID-19 patients, chemosensory deficit are reported, including losing their sense of smell, either partially or fully.This symptom, if it is present at all, often appears early in the illness. Loss of smell increases foodborne illness due to inability to detect spoiled food, and may increase fire hazards due to inability to detect smoke. Loss of smell may also be the result of inflammation in the olfactory bulb.A June 2020 systematic review found a 29–54% prevalence of olfactory dysfunction for people with COVID-19, while an August 2020 study using a smell-identification test reported that 96% of people with COVID-19 had some olfactory dysfunction, and 18% had total smell loss. As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~70% for loss of smell.A disturbance in smell or taste is more commonly found in younger people, and perhaps because of this, it is correlated with a lower risk of medical complications. Loss of taste and chemesthesis
In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily experience changes in how food tastes (dysgeusia or ageusia). As of January 2021, the mechanism for taste and chemesthesis symptoms were not well understood.A June 2020 systematic review found a 24–54% prevalence of gustatory dysfunction for people with COVID-19. 
Yeadon has said he personally doesn’t oppose the use of all vaccines.   It’s impossible to measure the impact of Yeadon’s claim that COVID-19 vaccines could cause female infertility. Anecdotally, though, many women have bought into it. https://t.co/GhJp0v0zLX [SEP] Michael Yeadon is a British anti-vaccine activist and retired pharmacologist who attracted media attention in 2020 and 2021 for making false or unfounded claims about the COVID-19 pandemic and the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Several of Yeadon's false or misleading claims have been amplified on social media.Yeadon has claimed without evidence that COVID-19 vaccines were unnecessary, unsafe, 
and could cause infertility in women. A Telegram account under his name has promoted the unfounded claim that the vaccines cause recipients to become magnetic.Yeadon has been interviewed by The Exposé, a website known for publishing COVID-19 misinformation. In an interview with American political strategist Steve Bannon, Yeadon falsely asserted that children were "50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself", citing a high number of events following COVID-19 vaccination reported on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. Reproductive health
In a December 2020 petition to the European Medicines Agency, German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and British researcher Michael Yeadon suggested, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines could cause infertility in women by targeting the syncytin-1 protein necessary for placenta formation. A survey of young women in the United Kingdom later found that more than a quarter would refuse COVID-19 vaccines out of concerns for their effects on fertility. David Gorski wrote on Science-Based Medicine that Wodarg and Yeadon were "stoking real fear [...] based on speculative nonsense".False claims that a vaccinated person could "shed" SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, allegedly causing menstrual irregularities or other harmful effects on the reproductive health of non-vaccinated women who are in proximity to them, such as miscarriage, were cited by the Centner Academy, a private school in Miami, which announced it would not employ teachers who received the COVID-19 vaccine. Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States "can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy". 
 Remestemcel-L therapy heals vascular damage caused by covid ARDS & ther conditions like spinal, diabetic neuropathy reducing risk of amputations. It will treat heart tissue damage, graft v host. Bone stemcells are the future.Treatment is here! $msb $meso #mesoblast https://t.co/zaQH2hqLnW [SEP] Stem-cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. It is an allogenic stem therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of adult donors. Some preliminary clinical trials achieved only modest improvements in heart function following use of bone marrow stem cell therapy.Stem-cell therapy for treatment of myocardial infarction usually makes use of autologous bone-marrow stem cells, but other types of adult stem cells may be used, such as adipose-derived stem cells.Possible mechanisms of recovery include:
Generation of heart muscle cells
Stimulating growth of new blood vessels to repopulate damaged heart tissue
Secretion of growth factors

Criticisms
In 2013, studies of autologous bone-marrow stem cells on ventricular function were found to contain "hundreds" of discrepancies. Clinical trials
Regenerative treatment models
Stem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as endothelial progenitor cells, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting apoptosis, and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.To further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas, and consequently promote tissue regeneration, platelet-rich plasma could be used in conjunction with stem cell transplantation. Stem cells have been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. Adult mesenchymal stem cells are being used by researchers in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering to artificially reconstruct human tissue which has been previously damaged. Treated disorders
Mesenchymal stem cells have been used to treat a variety of disorders including cardiovascular diseases, spinal cord injury, bone and cartilage repair, and autoimmune diseases. Cardiovascular Diseases
Mesenchymal stem cells are able to alleviate heart fiber injury and prevent cardiac muscle cell death in mouse models of myocardial infarction, or heart attack, and prevent its further development. 
Some people I know who survived covid infection seem to be prediabetic now. This seems to be a side effect of the infection, perhaps caused by inflammatory damage to the pancreas. Treatment with corticosteroids may cause more damage through elevated blood glucose. [SEP] Prediabetes is a component of the metabolic syndrome and is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that fall below the threshold to diagnose diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms
Prediabetes typically has no distinct signs or symptoms except the sole sign of high blood sugar. In individuals with prediabetes, a failure of pancreatic hormone release, failure of targeted tissues to respond to the insulin present or both leads to blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels. Complications of diabetes are a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19, are more common and severe among individuals with poorly controlled diabetes. More commonly undiagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes are brought to clinical attention with corticosteroid treatment because subclinical hyperglycemia worsens and becomes symptomatic. If left untreated, this can result in diabetic coma and death. Before treatment this results in high blood sugar levels in the body. 
Covid conundrum: vaccine known to cause headaches, sore arm, fatigue and nausea which are also symptom requiring testing. Must all vaccinated be tested? [SEP] In August 2020, scientists at the University of Southern California reported the "likely" order of initial symptoms of the COVID-19 disease as a fever followed by a cough and muscle pain, and that nausea and vomiting usually appear before diarrhea. Neurological
Patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and dysgeusia. However, headache could be mistaken for having a random relationship with COVID-19; there is unambiguous evidence that COVID-19 patients who had never had a recurrent headache suddenly get a severe headache daily because of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion. The FDA observed that the "frequency of reported Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population".Debate is still ongoing about whether or not there is a causal link between any of the major COVID-19 vaccines and Bell's palsy. This applies generally to all COVID-19 vaccines, including those not yet given formal approval. The Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof. Chris Whitty, tweeted in September 2021 that "The majority of our hospitalised Covid patients are unvaccinated and regret delaying their vaccines" with about 60% of all hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in the UK being of unvaccinated individuals. Early symptoms may include fever, headache, and feeling tired. 
   Several. Heart attack or brain stroke most common cause. That apart, lot of vaccinated people also contracting Covid in some weeks. Several getting serious and some fatalities too. [SEP] Research demonstrates patients infected with influenza as well as Covid are over twice as likely to die as patients with only Covid. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Some children with COVID-19 who develop Kawasaki disease, which is a multi-system inflammatory syndrome that also cerebrovascular disease and neurologic involvement. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, new lineages often differ from one another by just a few nucleotides.Some of the potential consequences of emerging variants are the following:
Increased transmissibility
Increased morbidity
Increased mortality
Ability to evade detection by diagnostic tests
Decreased susceptibility to antiviral drugs (if and when such drugs are available)
Decreased susceptibility to neutralising antibodies, either therapeutic (e.g., convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) or in laboratory experiments
Ability to evade natural immunity (e.g., causing reinfections)
Ability to infect vaccinated individuals
Increased risk of particular conditions such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome or long COVID. Cross-species transmission
There is a risk that COVID-19 could transfer from humans to other animal populations and could combine with other animal viruses to create yet more variants that are dangerous to humans. 
Makes perfect sense considering that asthma is a chronic lung inflammation, and COVID19 causes severe acute lung inflammation (hence the name SARS-Cov2, of which SARS stands for Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome).. can't get a lung infection if you already have it chronically. [SEP] SARS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-1. Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality. Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is strongly associated with development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children. Infectious asthma
When queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the "infectious asthma" (IA) syndrome, or as "asthma associated with infection" (AAWI) to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Certainly not. We need much stricter #Idling laws to protect our #Children. #ToxicFumes cause #ChildAsthma stunt children’s #Lung and #Brain development and can cause life long #RespiratoryDisease. #ToxicAir also makes #coronavirus symptoms worse. Surely #ActiveTravel is needed https://t.co/InJAcViVDU https://t.co/rJ1puacgdF [SEP] A number of possible health hazards of air travel have been investigated. In one study, the flight ban imposed following the attacks of September 11, 2001 was found to have restricted the global spread of seasonal influenza, resulting in a much milder influenza season that year, and the ability of influenza to spread on aircraft has been well documented. There is no standardisation of air handling by aircraft, installation of HEPA filters or of hand washing by air crew, and no published information on the relative efficacy of any of these interventions in reducing the spread of infection.Air travel, like other forms of travel, radically increases the speed at which infections spread around the world, as viruses rapidly spread to large numbers of people living across the world. According to a health expert in Canada, even though the risk of a blood clot is low, given the number of people who fly, it is a public health risk. Medicinal drugs should not be ruled out completely right from the start just because they possibly could cause pulmonary toxicity. Particulate matter leading to pulmonary toxicity
Atmospheric particulate matter is part of air pollution. In this context, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as seat belts, airbags and strong body structures. However, active safety is increasingly being used to describe systems that use an understanding of the state of the vehicle to both avoid and minimise the effects of a crash. 
   Why can't you comprehend nuance? They can be encouraged about ImmunityBio's 2nd gen hAd5 vaccine, which does not cause HIV issues, among other benefits. That doesn't mean it's the primary reason for doing the trial in SA. https://t.co/D67cCv9mLf [SEP] The trial is conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network and sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Vaccinations were stopped in April 2013 due to initial results showing that the vaccine was ineffective in preventing HIV infections and lowering viral load among those participants who had become infected with HIV. Potential participants were tested for antibodies to Adenovirus 5 as part of the screening process to determine their eligibility.When the study began the primary outcome being measured was whether the vaccine decreased the viral load, which is amount of HIV in the blood of study participants who received the vaccine then later became infected with HIV. At that time, researchers stated that the vaccine was very unlikely to provide any protection from HIV infection. The STEP Study was a Phase IIb clinical trial intended to study the efficacy of an experimental HIV vaccine based on a human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5) vector. In South Africa the trial was overseen by the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative.These trials were terminated before their scheduled conclusion, when the Data Safety Monitoring Board determined that the vaccine was not preventing HIV infection, and was possibly enhancing susceptibility to HIV infection in some of the study participants. Candidates for enrollment into the study were men and women identified as high risk for acquiring HIV infection but who were currently HIV-negative.The vaccine contained three separate replication-defective vectors based on Human Adenovirus C serotype 5 (HAdV-5). Vaccine implications
2F5 is not the only HIV-1-neutralizing antibody found; however, it is the broadest and prevents viral infection when transferred passively to macaques infected with chimeric simian-humans immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), making it a focus of research on development of an HIV-1 vaccine.A major goal recently in HIV-1 vaccinations is eliciting the broadly neutralizing antibodies before the virus is actually established, since the virus integrates itself into the host's DNA. 
 AZ jabber here. I think there are 27m of us.. Am about to have 2nd one. My view is that Covid- or our immune response to Covid- can cause clotting in a very few unlucky folks. So you are still better off having the jab than Covid itself & at least we know what signs to look for [SEP] There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. The study included 294 participants who presented with symptoms of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after receipt of the first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, showing an independent association between baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage.

   Vaxed could have lowered immune systems for days after the vaccination that could cause more problems. There are prophylatics available. Does Haiti use Ivermectin as standard and few covid cases and Dominican republic I think gave care staff,  doctors something different. Better? [SEP] Haiti has vaccinated around 123k people as of May 2022, having a 1.1% vaccination rate. The Haitian government is yet to accept the free Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines offered by U.N backed COVAX due to safety and logistical concerns. It appeared to Kempe, that the presence of the antibodies blocked viral replication and therefore a transfusion of antibodies from people who were immune due to vaccination, would help those in whom vaccination had failed.Two intravenous formulations of VIG (VIGIV Cangene and VIGIV Dynport) have been licensed by the FDA for the management of patients with progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, and extensive body surface involvement or periocular implantation following inadvertent inoculation.Cangene (a subsidiary of Emergent BioSolutions) brand-name VIGIV may be known to you by an alternate name: C-VIG; CNJ 016; NP 016 - Cangene; VIG; VIGIV - Emergent BioSolutions. Vaccines as a cause of death
United States
Claims have been made that data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveals a hidden toll of COVID-19 vaccine related deaths. Vaccine hesitancy
Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, the lower perceived risk of catching COVID-19 when it was under control, misinformation about the vaccines' side effects and efficacy, as well as political events and distrust of the HKSAR government, contributed to a low rate of vaccination. While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts. The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, and Brazilian Thoracic Society issued position statements advising against the use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of early-stage COVID‑19. Vaccine (or sometimes vaksin) are rudimentary single-note trumpets found in Haiti and, to a lesser extent, the Dominican Republic as well as Jamaica.

Long COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. Treatment and management
As of 2022, there are no established pharmaceutical treatments for long COVID, although numerous clinical trials are in progress to establish the efficacy and safety of possible therapies.Management of long COVID depends on symptoms, with current guidelines recommending multidisciplinary rehabilitation to improve symptoms and quality of life.

    Again anecdotally, I’ve spent the last few months giving falls leaflets and “Keeping Fit and Active” leaflets to my friends’ parents. I think the physical deconditioning from Covid has caused enormous problems in terms of falls risk, loss of muscle bulk and cognitive decline [SEP] COVID-19
A study in England found a linear increase in severe COVID-19 resulting in hospitalisation and death for those whose BMI is above 23, and a linear increase in admission to an intensive care unit across the whole BMI spectrum. A study from Mexico found that obesity alone was responsible for a 2.7 times increased risk of death from COVID-19, while comorbidities with diabetes, immunosuppression or high blood pressure increased the risk further. Insufficient physical activity is the most common health issue in the world. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscle strength, balance and endurance, all risk factors for falling. Health system responses
Australia
In October 2020, a guide published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) says that ongoing post-COVID-19 infection symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain will require management by GPs, in addition to the more severe conditions already documented.In December 2021, research by a health economics expert at Deakin University suggests that even without fully understanding the Omicron variant's effects yet, a further 10,000 to 133,000 long COVID cases are likely to emerge on top of the current approximately 9450 in New South Wales and 19,800 in Victoria, after border and other restrictions had been recently lifted. The guideline was reviewed by representatives of the UK doctors #longcovid group, an online support group for COVID long-haulers, who said that it could be improved by introducing a more comprehensive description of the clinical features and physical nature of long COVID, among other changes.In November 2021 complaints were reported from NHS staff that neither their employers nor their trades unions were supportive, though the British Medical Association was pushing for long COVID to be classed as an occupational disease.In May 2022 demand for occupational therapy led rehabilitation services in Britain was reported to have increased by 82% over the previous six months as occupational therapists were supporting people whose needs have become more complex because of delays in treatment brought about by the pandemic.

I was much more sad that my work won't allow me to bring banana bread for everyone because of covid than I was to find out the j&j vaccine could cause blood clots [SEP] On 5 May 2022 the FDA posted a bulletin limiting the use of the Janssen Vaccine to very specific cases due to further reassesment of the risks of TTS, although the FDA also stated in the same bulletin that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.In April 2021, AstraZeneca and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) updated their information for healthcare professionals about AZD1222, saying it is "considered plausible" that there is a causal relationship between the vaccination and the occurrence of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia and that, "although such adverse reactions are very rare, they exceeded what would be expected in the general population". There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect. The EMA states the overall risk-benefit for the Janssen vaccine remains positive.On 16 December 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should be preferred over the Janssen vaccine, following growing concerns about rare blood clots. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". 
 Here‘s why you should get the vaccine. Covid causes inflammation to the central nervous system and can cause damage including strokes and psychosis. Since you play a game that also causes brain injuries, it would be best for you to not have your brain fight both. [SEP] Although the response is initiated to protect the central nervous system from the infectious agent, the effect may be toxic and widespread inflammation as well as further migration of leukocytes through the blood–brain barrier may occur. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural function, leading to illness and complications, many of which frequently are neurological in nature, such as impaired motor skills and altered behavior. 
 masks cause plague... fauci knows... masks promote bacteria... and not the good kind... sinus/lung/teeth and gum/tongue/etc... bacteriological infections... covid is crimes against humanity (:~:)https://t.co/VvPRwcVGPx [SEP] It is pathogenic. Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Plague bacteria secrete several toxins, one of which is known to cause beta-adrenergic blockade.Y. In cases of surgical mask shortages, patient overcrowding, poor ventilation in hospital wards, or other crisis situations, pre-exposure prophylaxis might be warranted if sufficient supplies of antimicrobials are available.Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for people who had close (<6 feet), sustained contact with a patient with pneumonic plague and were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment. Biological weapon
The plague has a long history as a biological weapon. "Antimicrobial Treatment and Prophylaxis of Plague: Recommendations for Naturally Acquired Infections and Bioterrorism Response" (PDF). Wearing a close-fitting surgical mask also protects against infection.The mortality rate from untreated pneumonic plague approaches 100%. The outbreak was feared to be much worse because the plague superficially resembles other common diseases such as influenza and bronchitis; over 200 people that had been quarantined were released when they did not test positive for the plague. 
 yeah pfzier causes blood clots and tumors too and j&j causes blood clots but they're RARE and you really don't want covid instead [SEP] Prothrombin G20210A is a genetic condition that increases the risk of blood clots including from deep vein thrombosis, and of pulmonary embolism. Most people never develop a blood clot in their lifetimes.It is due to a specific gene mutation in which a guanine (G) is changed to an adenine (A) at position 20210 of the DNA of the prothrombin gene. Other blood clotting pathway mutations that increase the risk of clots include factor V Leiden. Increased production of prothrombin heightens the risk of blood clotting. Most individuals do not require treatment but do need to be cautious during periods when the possibility of blood clotting are increased; for example, during pregnancy, after surgery, or during long flights. Occasionally, blood-thinning medication may be indicated to reduce the risk of clotting.Heterozygous carriers who take combined birth control pills are at a 15-fold increased risk of VTE, while carriers also heterozygous with factor V Leiden have an approximate 20-fold higher risk. Oral contraceptives should generally be avoided in women with the mutation as they increase the thrombotic risk. Other carcinoids and adenocarcinomas may require right hemicolectomy. 
AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine is linked to another bleeding disorder that can cause purple-dotted rash https://t.co/NhPMh8uQkI [SEP] It causes a characteristic red or purple bruise-like rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), or vaccine-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VATT), are rare types of blood clotting syndromes that were initially observed in a number of people who had previously received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine (AZD1222) during the COVID‑19 pandemic. There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Analysis of VigiBase reported embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, found a temporally related incidence of 0.21 cases per 1 million vaccinated-days.Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are known side effects of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. 
Secrets of ANCIENT AYURVEDA prevented AUTO IMMUNE DISEASES.CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL only IVERMECTIN can save planet from COVID (AS OF NOW),NOT VACCINES which causes every vaccinated human to be a DEVIL’S WORKSHOP to create MUTATED STRAINS OF SARS COV 2 VIRUS.  [NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZBFscnhjx1 [SEP] is a Toronto-based emergency physician and professor who led a one-man anti-vaccine counter protest in 2021, triggering a change in legislation. V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai (born Vellayappa Ayyadurai Shiva, December 2, 1963) is an Indian-American engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and anti-vaccine activist. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ayyadurai became known for a social media COVID-19 disinformation campaign, spreading conspiracy theories about the cause of COVID-19, promoting unfounded COVID-19 treatments, and campaigning to fire Anthony Fauci for allegedly being a deep state actor. CSIR India
In 2009, Ayyadurai was hired by India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India's largest science agency, by its director general, Samir K. Brahmachari. COVID-19 misinformation
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ayyadurai used social media to spread various conspiracy theories and misinformation about the pandemic. Ayyadurai defined COVID-19 as "an overactive dysfunctional immune system that overreacts and that's what causes damage to the body", and claimed that vitamin C could be used to treat it.He alleged that COVID-19 was spread by the "deep state" and accused Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of being a "Deep State Plant". Ayyadurai called for Fauci to be fired and his supporters lobbied for Fauci to be replaced by Ayyadurai.In March 2020, Ayyadurai published an open letter to then-U.S. President Donald Trump, writing that a national lockdown was unnecessary and advocated that large doses of vitamins could prevent and cure COVID-19.

  The error in dealing with the Covid19 was preventing treatments without the so called vaccine. HCQ and Ivermectin were/are good treatments. That cause a large number of unnecessary deaths. And then the nursing home insanity. Bureaucrap and ComDem_Covid_Dictators. [SEP] The World Health Organization (WHO), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) all advise against using ivermectin in an attempt to treat or prevent COVID-19. Several publications that supported the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID‑19 have been retracted due to errors, unverifiable data, and ethical concerns.Several high-profile publications purporting to demonstrate reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients were later retracted due to suspected data falsification. After reviewing the evidence on ivermectin, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) advised against its use for prevention or treatment of COVID‑19 and that "the available data do not support its use for COVID‑19 outside well-designed clinical trials." In the United Kingdom, the national COVID‑19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel determined that the evidence base and plausibility of ivermectin as a COVID‑19 treatment were insufficient to pursue further investigations. The World Health Organization advised that ivermectin should not be used to treat COVID‑19 except in a clinical trial. Due to lacking evidence of efficacy and growing body of retracted pro-ivermectin papers, SAHPRA revoked the compassionate use program in May 2022.Despite the absence of high-quality evidence to suggest any efficacy and advice to the contrary, some governments have allowed its off-label use for prevention and treatment of COVID‑19. The executive order was signed on 2 April 2020.On 5 June 2020, use of hydroxychloroquine in the UK RECOVERY Trial was discontinued when an interim analysis of 1,542 treatments showed it provided no mortality benefit to people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection over 28 days of observation.On 15 June 2020, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, stating that although the evaluation of both these drugs under clinical trials continues, the FDA (after interagency consultation with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)) concluded that, based on new information and other information discussed "... it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks".On 23 July 2020, results were published from a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-group, controlled trial of 667 participants in Brazil which found no benefit from using hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The authors came to the conclusion that no further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 should be carried out.On 26 April 2021, in its amended clinical management protocol for COVID-19, the Indian Ministry of Health lists hydroxycholoquine for use in patients during the early course of the disease. 
Giving yourself a tension headache by worrying that you might get a headache which could indicate that you’ve developed blood clots after your covid jab, even though you know you didn’t have the one that can cause blood clots and just scared yourself reading the side-effects. https://t.co/0kokui7ui6 [SEP] A vascular headache is an outdated term to describe certain types of headache which were thought to be related to blood vessel swelling and hyperemia as cause of pain.There is no doubt that some headaches are caused by vascular effects. There are many types of vascular headaches. Other types of vascular headaches include headaches produced by fever, cluster headaches, and headaches from a rise in blood pressure (OSU Wexner Medical Center, 2012). Headaches that were described as being vascular headaches include:
Cluster headache
Migraine
Toxic headache

== External links == Symptoms may include large bruises, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, confusion, and headache. Frequently reported symptoms include feeling very tired, confusion, and headaches. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress, which damages their membranes, leading to rupture of red blood cells within blood vessels, which in turn leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and schistocyte formation. The presence of these blood clots in the small blood vessels reduces blood flow to organs resulting in cellular injury and end organ damage. 
  I too have autoimmune disease. I have been vaccinated fully. The danger of Covid 19 outweighed the risk of side effects. The only side effect I had? Was flu like symptoms with the second dose. No lasting effect. The unvaccinated are the new 21 st century Lepers. Cause Variants [SEP] While the vaccine is made with a live virus which can cause side effects, these are far fewer and less serious than the sickness and death caused by measles itself; side effects ranging from rashes to, rarely, convulsions, occur in a small percentage of recipients.Measles is common worldwide. Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. 
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause a disorder characterized by dangerous blood clots and low platelet counts. In Europe, at least 222 suspected cases have been reported among people who have received the vaccine. More than 30 have died. [SEP] None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. April global restrictions and legal dispute
On 7 April, following further review of the data, the EMA concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots when in combination with low levels of blood platelets (Embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination). Although no causal link with vaccination has been shown, several other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia also halted the vaccine rollout over the following days while waiting for the EMA to finish a safety review triggered by the cases.In April 2021, the EMA concluded its safety review and concluded that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects while reaffirming the overall benefits of the vaccine. Then, on 15 April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommended to the government to permanently suspended vaccination with AstraZeneca due to the "rare but severe incidents with low platelet counts, blood clots, and haemorrhages," since in the case of Norway, "the risk of dying after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine would be higher than the risk of dying from the disease, particularly for younger people." AstraZeneca confirmed on 14 March 2021 that after examining over 17 million people who have been vaccinated with the vaccine, no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots in any particular country was found. The company reported that as of 8 March 2021, across the EU and UK, there had been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, which is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of that size.In March 2021, the German Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI) reported that out of 1.6 million vaccinations, seven cases of cerebral vein thrombosis in conjunction with a deficiency of blood platelets had occurred. The DHPC indicated that a causal relationship between the vaccine and blood clots (thrombosis) in combination with low blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) was plausible and identified it as a very rare side effect of the vaccine. 
 Allopathic medicines are very costly. They eliminate the symptoms of diseases and cause other diseases in the body.  Asharamji Bapu has got many side effects in His body with allopathic medicines in the treatment of covid, so we demand for Ayurvedic medicine. #आयुर्वेद_हमारी_शान [SEP] Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used by 19th-century homeopaths to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern evidence-based medicine . American health advocate and sceptic William T. Jarvis, stated that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular medicine." Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness or to alleviate an illness by eliminating its cause. "Hahnemann used "allopathy" to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence the Greek root allo- "different") from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. As used by homeopaths, the term allopathy has always referred to the principle of treating disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). American health educator and skeptic William T. Jarvis, stated in 2008 that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular medicine".Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Samuel Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.

 LOSE WEIGHT!!!! More than 40% of US citizens are obese! Obesity causes diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, cancer, etc., i.e. exactly those underlying health problems which increase the risk of dying from Covid, also for younger people! LOSE WEIGHT NOW TO REDUCE RISK [SEP] COVID-19
A study in England found a linear increase in severe COVID-19 resulting in hospitalisation and death for those whose BMI is above 23, and a linear increase in admission to an intensive care unit across the whole BMI spectrum. A study from Mexico found that obesity alone was responsible for a 2.7 times increased risk of death from COVID-19, while comorbidities with diabetes, immunosuppression or high blood pressure increased the risk further. Weight loss decreases these risks. Mortality
Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. A study from the RAK Hospital found that obese people are at a greater risk of developing long COVID. The CDC has found that obesity is the single strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. Cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are the leading causes of both death and of the burden of disease, and exposure to risk factors is high: more than 300 million men smoke cigarettes and 160 million adults are hypertensive, most of whom are not being treated. The prevention of chronic diseases is now receiving a national response commensurate with the burden. 
    COVID can cause horrible and debilitating secondary effects among those who survive. Lung, heart, and brain issues, as well as blood clots and circulation issues, have all been linked to COVID.  They don't go away when the initial infection is resolved. https://t.co/1gLEegZStL [SEP] Although studies into long COVID are under way, as of May 2022 there is no consensus on the definition of the term.Long COVID may affect multiple organ systems, including disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, mental health, metabolism, musculoskeletal pain, anemia and exercise intolerance/ post-exertional malaise. The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Causes
It is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for much longer.A March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:
direct toxicity in virus-infected tissue, especially the lungs
ongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation
vascular injury and ischemia caused by virus-induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)
impaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2-containing tissueIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:
permanent damage to the lungs and heart,
post-intensive care syndrome,
Post-viral fatigue, sometimes regarded as the same as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
continuing COVID-19 symptoms, and
damage to the blood which deprives the body of oxygen.Other situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:

the virus being present for a longer time than usual, due to an ineffective immune response;
reinfection (e.g., with another strain of the virus);
damage caused by inflammation and a strong immune response to the infection;
post-traumatic stress or other mental sequelae, especially in people who had previously experienced anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other mental health difficulties;
inhibited oxygen exchange as a result of persistent circulating blood plasma microclots; and
development of various autoantibodies after infection. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
 My family of 4, NO SIDE EFFECTS!! Just saw a Real Housewife blaming her ZIT on the Covid vaccine! People are so damn stupid!! Vaccines don't cause pimples!! [SEP] These aluminium salts can be responsible for soreness and redness at the vaccination site but do not cause any long-term harm to human health. Zostavax
The live vaccine (Zostavax) is very safe; one to a few percent of people develop a mild form of chickenpox, often with about five or six blisters around the injection site, and without fever. Minor side effects may include pain at the site of injection, fever, and rash. The incidence of herpes zoster in vaccinated adults is 0.9/1000 person-years, and is 0.33/1000 person-years in vaccinated children; this is lower than the overall incidence of 3.2–4.2/1000 person-years.The risk of developing shingles is reduced for children who receive the varicella vaccine, but not eliminated. On some occasions, severe reactions such as meningitis and pneumonia have been reported (mainly in inadvertently vaccinated immunocompromised children) as well as anaphylaxis.The possible mild side effects include redness, stiffness, and soreness at the injection site, as well as fever. A few people may develop a mild rash, which usually appears around the injection site.There is a short-term risk of developing herpes zoster (shingles) following vaccination. : 378  Most of the cases reported have been mild and have not been associated with serious complications.Approximately 5% of children who receive the vaccine develop a fever or rash. The literature contains several reports of adverse reactions following varicella vaccination, including vaccine-strain zoster in children and adults. 
    Ffs! I don't know how many more times it can be explained to people really.[NEWLINE]Just because you have cancer or a brain tumour or anything else terminal. There are other causes of death that expedite the original cause of illness. Covid is one of those things. [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. Terminal illness or end-stage disease is a disease that cannot be cured or adequately treated and is expected to result in the death of the patient. There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. including in cases of 'long COVID'.

Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Brazil regulator rejects Sputnik V vaccine citing serious quality, safety concerns. Cells where adenovirus is produced “allow its replication,” which “can lead to infections in humans and can cause injury and death” #COVID19 #coronavirus  #CoronaVaccine  https://t.co/OHd3NbLcEm [SEP] Sputnik V (Russian: Спутник V, the brand name from RDIF) or Gam-COVID-Vac (Russian: Гам-КОВИД-Вак, the name under which it is legally registered and produced) is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia. Although a report from Argentina published in the New England Journal of Medicine described fatal vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in a young woman after receipt of Sputnik-V.

Pharmacology
Gam-COVID-Vac is a viral vector vaccine based on two recombinant replication-defective human adenoviruses: Ad26 (serotype 26) and Ad5 (serotype 5) replicated in HEK 293 cells. As of June 2021, Sputnik V is under rolling review process by EMA, but the marketing authorisation application was not submitted yet.Emergency use has also been authorized in Algeria, Bolivia, Serbia, the Palestinian territories, and Mexico.On 25 January 2021, Iran approved the vaccine, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif saying the country hopes to begin purchases and start joint production of the shot "in the near future", after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned the government from importing vaccines from the United States and United Kingdom.The Czech Republic is also considering buying Sputnik V, and Prime Minister Andrej Babis dismissed the minister of health, Jan Blatný, who was a loud opponent to the use of Sputnik V.On 4 March 2021, EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has started a rolling review of Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac), a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Russia's Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology. German medical experts have recommended its approval also, and consider the Sputnik Vaccine "clever" and "highly safe".On 19 March 2021, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for Sputnik V, the fourth COVID-19 vaccine to be given authorization. Brazil
On 26 April 2021, the Brazilian health regulator Anvisa rejected the use of Sputnik V, alleging a lack of consistent and reliable data and the presence of replicating adenovirus in the vaccine. Anvisa attributed its decision to a number of issues with the samples provided by Gamaleya for accreditation:
the adenovirus carrier in all samples was actually able to replicate in spite of manufacturer's declaration it was incapacitated
the methodology used by Gamaleya to check immune system response was unreliable and documentation provided made its verification impossible
the procedure of registering adverse effects was insufficient
Anvisa delegation was also not allowed into the Gamaleya laboratory for inspection
all presented studies were performed on vaccine doses produced in laboratory, rather than in the manufacturing facility supplying vaccine for the mass market, which makes the results not representative
Anvisa found issues in one of the factories in Russia that could impact sterility of the doses.On April 29, 2021, the developers of Sputnik V said that Anvisa admitted not testing Sputnik V and that they would sue Anvisa in Brazil for defamation. Medicinal chemist Derek Lowe commented that the presence of replicating adenoviruses is unlikely to cause any major problems, but it is a "completely unnecessary risk", that it certainly will harm some people, and that providing a product different from the one described in studies undermines the credibility of all manufacturing and quality control processes, adding that some posts on the official Sputnik V Twitter account constitute "aggressive political marketing" and some make invalid claims regarding the performance of competing vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. He also said that real-world data from Argentina and Mexico showed no adverse effects greater than those seen in people vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or CoronaVac.On June 4, Anvisa approved exceptional imports of Sputnik V, restricting it mainly to healthy adults and limiting it to only 1% of the population of 6 importing states, in order to manage risks through control and supervision of side effects. 
Such a dangerous decision. There were 6 instances out of 7 million vaccinations. Blood clots are a known complication of COVID-19, so it is not surprising that the immune response may cause them. Further, FDA approved birth control has an incidence of 1 in 1,000, yet still used. https://t.co/gOEZlCOQMu [SEP] On 5 May 2022 the FDA posted a bulletin limiting the use of the Janssen Vaccine to very specific cases due to further reassesment of the risks of TTS, although the FDA also stated in the same bulletin that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.In April 2021, AstraZeneca and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) updated their information for healthcare professionals about AZD1222, saying it is "considered plausible" that there is a causal relationship between the vaccination and the occurrence of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia and that, "although such adverse reactions are very rare, they exceeded what would be expected in the general population". Causes
The rare simultaneous occurrence of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) with blood clots after vaccination raised the original concern about this condition. The EMA had earlier said that a link between certain very rare blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine is "not proven, but is possible".Observations in Germany of these rare events seemed to relate mostly women aged under 55. She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. 
           In other words (translation into English), what u and those looking at cholinergic system disruption ( ) are saying is that neurological distress  leads to respiratory distress in covid, that neuro-mediated hypoximia causes covid pneumonia? [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. About 35% of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 experience neurological complications. Many patients with COVID-19 also experience more severe neurological symptoms. Coronavirus infections are defined as neurotropic viral infections (i.e., they tend to target the nervous system) which increases the risk of neuroinflammation and the induction of immune system dysfunction. About 20% of COVID-19 cases that pass through the intensive care unit (ICU) have chronic neurologic symptoms (beyond loss of smell and taste). Research into COVID-19 induced brain damage
Neurological complications in COVID-19 are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a complication of post infection which can be due to (1) direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the CNS via systemic circulation or olfactory epithelium directed trans-synaptic mechanism; (2) Inflammatory mediated CNS damage due to cytokine storm and endothelitis; (3) Thrombosis mediated CNS damage due to SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host ACE2 receptor resulting in ACE2 downregulation, coagulation cascade activation, and multiple organ dysfunction; (4) Hypoxemic respiratory failures and cardiorespiratory effects due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem.There is ongoing research about the short- and long-term damage COVID-19 may possibly cause to the brain. For instance, a study showed how COVID-19 may cause microvascular brain pathology and endothelial cell-death, disrupting the blood–brain barrier. Long COVID may contribute to inflammaging in aged individuals and lead to long term brain changes, rendering patients vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
   You are mistaken.  COVID-19 antibodies are ONLY made when a person gets the virus.  Whether a person gets sick depends on how healthy their immune system is or other factors.  Vaccines cause antibodies to be made by a person, without getting sick, just like in asym infections. [SEP] A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. During that time, the host can still become infected.Once antibodies are produced, they may promote immunity in any of several ways, depending on the class of antibodies involved. Antibodies are created by the recipient and may be stored permanently.Active immunization can occur naturally when  microbes or other antigen are received by a person who has not yet come into contact with the microbes and has no pre-made antibodies for defense. Natural antibodies
Humans and higher primates also produce "natural antibodies" that are present in serum before viral infection. mRNA vaccines are not vaccines
Financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur David Martin claimed that mRNA vaccines do not fit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definitions of a vaccine because they do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. While research has been ongoing to evaluate the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV 2 transmission, neither the CDC nor the FDA stipulate that vaccines must stop transmission of a virus, both stating that a vaccine is a product that stimulates the immune system to produce immunity to an infectious agent. Cancer
The website Natural News has published claims that mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 can cause cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressing proteins. The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. 
 We need to realize that COVID is a disorder of the Immune system. A disordered immune response leads to acute critical COVID and chronic inflammation causes PASC, #Leronlimab is an immunomodulator that has shown to help both groups of patients! [SEP] While long COVID is the most prevalent name, the terms long-haul COVID, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-COVID-19 condition, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), and chronic COVID syndrome (CCS) are also in use.Long COVID has no single, strict definition. American definition
In February 2021, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins indicated long COVID symptoms for individuals who "don't recover fully over a period of a few weeks" be collectively referred to as "Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection" (PASC). Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.Symptoms reported by adults with long COVID include:
Fatigue, including extreme fatigue
Substantial exercise intolerance more than three months after infection; post-exertional malaise similar to that which is the hallmark of chronic fatigue syndrome
Dysautonomia / Orthostatic Intolerance / Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
Long-lasting cough
Muscle weakness and/or pain
Low-grade fever
Inability to concentrate (brain fog)
Memory lapses
Mental health problems, such as changes in mood or depression
Sleep difficulties
Headaches
Joint pain
Prickling pain (paresthesia) in hands and feet
Diarrhea
Bouts of vomiting
Loss of, or changes in, sense of smell (anosmia or parosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia)
Sore throat and or difficulties swallowing
Circulation disorders, including new onsets of diabetes and hypertension
Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Skin rash
Shortness of breath
Chest pains
Palpitations
Kidney problems (including, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease)
Changes in oral health (teeth, saliva, gums)
Tinnitus and Hearing loss
Blood clotting (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)
Erectile dysfunctionOne study of 35,000 patients with long COVID symptoms found cases clustered into four major symptom patterns:
Subphenotype 1 (cardiac and renal), representing about 34% of people was dominated by cardiac-related, kidney-related and circulation-related issues, including cardiac and circulatory conditions, renal failure, anemia and fluid and electrolyte disorders. These conditions may have similar pathophysiology to long COVID. Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long COVID—A Practical Guide. Leronlimab (codenamed PRO 140) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the CCR5 receptor found on T lymphocytes of the human immune system. It is clear from these results that leronlimab saves lives and saves money.Former President of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, was administered leronlimab under Compassionate Special Permit (CSP), among other medication, as a therapeutic for COVID-19. Research
COVID-19
Leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody investigational drug under development by CytoDyn, Inc. (CytoDyn), is one of the potential medicines that has been studied to determine whether it is safe and effective in treating patients with COVID-19, including those with severe outcomes from COVID-19. 
      I wish more attention would be paid to the importance of the Pentose-Phosphate-Pathway in optimal immune function & how COVID demands G6PD/NADPH, etc - & inability of the body to supply can cause ALL severe &/or long reactions [SEP] The pentose phosphate pathway (also called the phosphogluconate pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt and the HMP Shunt) is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides. While the pentose phosphate pathway does involve oxidation of glucose, its primary role is anabolic rather than catabolic. Erythrocytes, for example, generate a large amount of NADPH through the pentose phosphate pathway to use in the reduction of glutathione. The entire set of reactions can be summarized as follows:

The overall reaction for this process is:

Glucose 6-phosphate + 2 NADP+ + H2O → ribulose 5-phosphate + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CO2

Non-oxidative phase
Net reaction:
3 ribulose-5-phosphate → 1 ribose-5-phosphate + 2 xylulose-5-phosphate → 2 fructose-6-phosphate + glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

Regulation
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the rate-controlling enzyme of this pathway. An NADPH-utilizing pathway forms NADP+, which stimulates Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce more NADPH. See also

  Yes, COVID-19 can cause various problems. The VACCINE cannot. [SEP] Cancer
The website Natural News has published claims that mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 can cause cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressing proteins. A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 can also cause severe disease in children. 
  Covid 19 causes blood clots that trigger heart attacks and strokes, explains why he was in perfect condition a few weeks ago, but the disease was silently ravaging his body [SEP] The most common cause is atrial fibrillation, which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation, but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too as infective endocarditis. This can be due to ischemia, thrombus, embolus (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed). This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls.

Myocardial infarction (heart attack)

Oxygen deprivation caused by face masks is weakening your immune system and harming your body.  Do not consent to this ritual which does nothing to prevent illness but actually causes it. #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #Health #healthylifestyle #HealthyLiving #healthy [SEP] Reasons
Reasons given by people who refuse to wear face masks range significantly, including: potential danger of wearing face masks due to personal health issues, physical discomfort, the absence or lack of symptoms of COVID-19 exhibited by the individual, alleged ineffectiveness at reducing COVID-19 transmission, or alleged exaggeration of the threats of the virus, while others object to governments having the power to force people to wear face coverings, such as passing certain mandates that require the population to wear it. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. In June 2020, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said asymptomatic individuals wearing face masks were not to be recommended due to the low prevalence of COVID-19 in the country but noted that it should be reconsidered if cases rise. Touching
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene." (September 2020), which links the seasonality of respiratory viral diseases to decreased air humidity due to indoor heating, argues that mask-wearing helps limit respiratory virus transmission in winter because masks keep the nose warm and moist.Social media claims that masks could reduce the oxygen levels in older people were refuted by a small study of SpO2 levels, the results of which were published by JAMA. Training masks are facial masks worn to limit the intake of air during breathing. This is especially relevant to elite athletes, where the pulmonary system may become a limiting factor.During a 6-week high-intensity training program, moderately trained subjects using training masks were found to have improved their endurance capacity (VO2 max) and power output significantly. Sites
Facial skin damage
Respiratory protective equipment need to be worn tightly on the face, which can lead to poor blood circulation, tissue ischemia and hypoxia. 
      It can be vasovagal syncope (which is basically a faint) - this is relatively common with flu for example which can cause people to feel dizzy/faint, but also with stress. It could be completely unrelated - e.g. a heart arrhythmia leading to collapse. [SEP] These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.Vasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:

Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions.Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the autonomic nervous system due to systemic diseases (e.g., amyloidosis or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).Hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. While these may appear as "fainting", they do not fit the strict definition of syncope being a sudden reversible loss of consciousness due to decreased blood flow to the brain. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. Heat syncope is fainting or dizziness as a result of overheating (syncope is the medical term for fainting). 
 Masks are a total hoax!! They do not stop the spread of corona virus,in fact bacteria levels are high from wearing the mask a couple of hours&we breathe in all that bacteria in to our lungs which can/does cause pneumonia&pneumonia kills. Let that sink In. Masks can kill us. [SEP] Masks or face coverings are worn to reduce the virus breathed out by an infected person (who may not know they are infected), as well as the virus breathed in by a susceptible person. Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. In August 2020, the CDC added that exhalation valves or vents in masks do not help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others.In a November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC reiterated their recommendation for the community use of masks and specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They concluded that the benefit of masking for SARS-CoV-2 control is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection, which is likely complementary and possibly synergistic so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use.The CDC said healthcare personnel should wear a NIOSH-approved N95 (or equivalent or higher-level) respirator or a face mask (if a respirator is not available) with a face shield or goggles as part of their personal protective equipment, while patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a face mask or cloth face covering during transport. Properly worn masks are effective in both limiting the spread of the virus by an infected individual and protecting an uninfected individual from infection.The National Health Commission of China cited the following reasons for the wearing of masks by the public, including healthy individuals:

Asymptomatic transmission. Efficacy
A systemic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of masks published in The BMJ in November 2021 showed that with 95% confidence, masks reduced COVID incidence by between 25% and 71%. In December 2021, a study in PNAS found that when two people wear surgical masks, while the infectious is speaking, the risk of infection remains below 30% after one hour, but when both wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, it is 0.4%.In February 2022, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that surgical masks worn at indoor public venues can reduce the chances of testing positive for COVID-19 by 66%, while tightfitting N95 and KN95 masks can reduce the odds of infection by 83%. 
 I don't consider ppls fears irrational in the least.  AZ drops platelets=could impact ppl with blood cancer badly.  TTS is extremely rare, meaning few things cause it other than AZ & Heparin.  The other name for it is 'Vaccine induced TTS'. 61 cases so far https://t.co/HqEMGTHIS7 [SEP] On 5 May 2022 the FDA posted a bulletin limiting the use of the Janssen Vaccine to very specific cases due to further reassesment of the risks of TTS, although the FDA also stated in the same bulletin that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.In April 2021, AstraZeneca and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) updated their information for healthcare professionals about AZD1222, saying it is "considered plausible" that there is a causal relationship between the vaccination and the occurrence of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia and that, "although such adverse reactions are very rare, they exceeded what would be expected in the general population". Causes
The rare simultaneous occurrence of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) with blood clots after vaccination raised the original concern about this condition. There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the specific syndrome - of embolic and thrombotic events in combination with low levels of blood platelets - presenting in post-vaccination cases raised the possibility of an association between the vaccine and the relatively rare syndrome. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day. "Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: what we know and do not know". Platelet transfusions are generally not recommended.About 1 per 100,000 people are affected. 
  It isn’t denial... the real issue is the mental health problems that your lockdown measures have and will cause.  Suicides and opioid OD are going to be far higher than any Covid deaths and to much younger and physically healthier individuals. [SEP] COVID-19 has increased the risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma, and stress, all of which can lead to suicide and suicidal behavior. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses were put on hold, many people have been laid off from work, and the stock market has experienced significant drops in history, all resulting in fear of the financial crisis.Stigma is also identified as a primary cause of suicide. In 2017, President Donald Trump officially declared the opioid crisis a "public health emergency." Additionally, anxiety and fear associated with infection can lead to discriminatory behaviors, which then lead to increasingly negative social behaviors, worsening mental health.A systematic review and meta-analyses explored the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population in the UK during the first COVID-19 lockdown. This review found that there was a 26.35% increase in anxiety during the COVID-19 lockdown. A journal investigated a relationship with suicide rates in nursing finding “elevated suicide rates for nurses compared with other, non-healthcare providers.”
Rapid spread of COVID-19 in long-term care settings impacted the quality of care in such facilities during the pandemic. The implementation of pandemic-related visitor restrictions also potentially contributed negatively to the emotional well-being, loneliness, and quality of life of long-term care residents.It is crucial to understand how mental health disorders can be combatted and managed. A study of Chinese participants showed that adolescents also had negative impacts to their wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown. 
  To quote from the article "There is no proof, however, that the vaccine caused these cases" Also "COVID-19 itself can cause myocarditis" [SEP] Viral cardiomyopathy occurs when viral infections cause myocarditis with a resulting thickening of the myocardium and dilation of the ventricles. COVID-19 Cardiomyopathy
Patients with Covid-19 frequently experience heart issues. According to studies, people who have had previous cardiovascular conditions like cardiomyopathy, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or arrhythmia are more likely to become critically ill from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Myocarditis may result from a direct viral infection of the myocardium. Hundreds of studies have reported myocarditis/myopericarditis caused by Covid-19 infection in living patients, with a male predominance (58%), and a median age of 50 years. See also

Myocarditis on emedicine This was also reported in The BMJ in October 2021, in a piece which said that "[a]mong the people admitted to hospital with severe respiratory failure from Covid-19 pneumonia who have subsequently died, some had previously held strong anti-vaccine beliefs. A study published in JAMA showed an increased risk for myocarditis within seven days of vaccination. 
 People are not experts at understanding absolute and relative risk. -The vaccine may cause this as do other meds and infections -The risk is so low that it's hard to find a background rate and prove it's above baseline -It's a hell of a lot lower than thrombotic risk of COVID [SEP] However, the specific syndrome - of embolic and thrombotic events in combination with low levels of blood platelets - presenting in post-vaccination cases raised the possibility of an association between the vaccine and the relatively rare syndrome. The reasoning is because in the 20-29 age range the benefits to individual of vaccination were less as their likelihood of harm from COVID‑19 is less and closer to the potential risk of harm from the vaccine (at a medium exposure risk with COVID‑19 infection cases running at a rate of 60 per 100,000). While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded.

"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". "Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: what we know and do not know". Studies have found possible causal links between the AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines and a rare clotting disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), but the risk is low for most people, with 47 confirmed reports of the condition out of more than 15 million recipients of the Janssen vaccine in the United States as of October 2021. 
 So much fake news on this Covid is clearly a  virus and , yes,with a compromised immune system Bacteria will thrive. Covid kills by clotting and, particularly in damaging lung efficiency. Hypoxia can cause heart failure. [SEP] Bacteria can travel from the lung into the blood stream (bacteremia) and can result in serious illness such as sepsis and eventually septic shock, in which there is low blood pressure leading to damage in multiple parts of the body including the brain, kidney, and heart. An extremely sick individual may require artificial ventilation and intensive care as life-saving measures while his or her immune system fights off the infectious cause with the help of antibiotics and other drugs. Causes
One theory relating to COVID-19 presentation suggests the impaired processing of severe hypoxia and resumption of normal breathing may be due to the neurological pathway by which the virus spreads from the oral cavity to the brain. It has been shown that the breathing rates of patients with COVID-19 gradually increase, which in turn leads to silent hypoxia. Presentation
In COVID-19, the arterial and general tissue oxygen levels can drop without any initial warning. Cases of silent hypoxia with COVID-19 have been reported for patients who did not experience shortness of breath or coughing until their oxygen levels had depressed to such a degree that they were at risk of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and organ failure. Prognosis
The prognosis for silent hypoxia in COVID-19 is generally poor, as oxygen levels in the blood can drop below 50 percent without being noticed. Epidemiology
Known to be associated with:

Altitude sickness
Atypical pneumonia
COVID-19
Inert gas asphyxiation
Occupational accidents involving asphyxiant environments
Rebreather malfunctions
Technical diving accidents

 Covid causes heart inflammation in like 70% of people (including asymptomatic).  That seems like a high rate of heart inflammation. [SEP] The mechanism by which coxsackie B viruses (CBVs) trigger inflammation is believed to be through the recognition of CBV virions by Toll-like receptors.The binding of many types of coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, through ACE2 receptors present in heart muscle may be responsible for direct viral injury leading to myocarditis. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs). Diagnosis
Myocarditis refers to an underlying process that causes inflammation and injury of the heart. A similar relationship was found between a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, increased mortality, and increased major adverse cardiovascular events.Myocarditis has been reported to be a major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in infants, adolescents, and young adults, but the reported rates show wide variation (1 to 14 percent) among young people depending on differences in SCD definition and classification/ definition of myocarditis post-mortem as well as heterogeneity of study populations.In fulminant myocarditis, in which an inflammatory cytokine storm occurs, cardiac functions decline rapidly and the death rate is high. If one tests positive for an acute viral infection, clinical developments have discovered that 1-5% of said population may show some form of myocarditis.In regard to the population affected, myocarditis is more common in pregnant women, children, and those who are immunocompromised. Other estimates of the incidence of myocarditis in those with COVID-19 range from 2.4 cases of definite/probable myocarditis (based on clinical criteria) per 1,000 people with COVID-19 to 4.1 cases per 1,000 persons in those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.Although myocarditis is relatively rare in those with COVID-19, when it is present it is likely to follow a severe and fulminant course for those previously hospitalized with COVID-19. Comorbidities
It is firmly established that systemic markers for inflammation predict coronary heart disease complications with or without existing heart disease. 
  My 6 year old was stressed too.  I just told him some mainicured facts. The AZ vaccine uses a virus which can cause the common cold to transport the material which helps your body learn how to beat COVID. So sometimes you get some similar effects to a cold or flu.  Seemed to help [SEP] Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. Fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. Currently the CDC recommends that everyone except infants under the age of six months should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Flu vaccines are contraindicated for people who have experienced a severe allergic reaction in response to a flu vaccine or to any component of the vaccine. Side effects of a nasal spray vaccine may include runny nose, wheezing, sore throat, cough, or vomiting.In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case for prescription drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. A hexavalent vaccine, or 6-in-1 vaccine, is a combination vaccine with six individual vaccines conjugated into one, intended to protect people from multiple diseases. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.There is no vaccine for the common cold. 
   I do But they are hardly bad for you also Experimental ones sure   But vaccines save more lives then risk any day  The covid vaccine cause me to vomit and made me very poorly But I hadn't taken vets and my immune system was in tatters so meh [SEP] Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. There are several types of vaccines in use. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Flu vaccines are contraindicated for people who have experienced a severe allergic reaction in response to a flu vaccine or to any component of the vaccine. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza. Side effects with both types of vaccines, but especially the whole-cell vaccine, are less common the younger the child. 
  Nothing like that ..... Now the reason the vaccine will cause this it's a side effect when one takes the vaccine. Covid-19 does not cause erectile distinction. [SEP] Adverse effects from the vaccine are higher than placebo, but placebo arms of vaccine trials still reported adverse effects that can be attributed to the nocebo effect.All vaccines that are administered via intramuscular injection, including COVID‑19 vaccines, have side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the procedure and introduction of a foreign substance into the body. Like any other vaccine, some people are allergic to one or more ingredients in COVID‑19 vaccines. Other temporary menstrual effects have been reported, such as heavier than normal menstrual bleeding after vaccination.Serious adverse events associated COVID‑19 vaccines are generally rare but of high interest to the public. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is significantly higher (up to 11 times higher with respect to myocarditis) after COVID-19 infection as compared to COVID-19 vaccination, with the possible exception of younger men (less than 40 years old) who may have a higher risk of myocarditis after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine (an additional 97 cases of myocarditis per 1 million persons vaccinated).thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other autoimmune diseases, which have been reported as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine.There are rare reports of subjective hearing changes, including tinnitus, after vaccination. Magnetization
Some social media users have falsely asserted COVID-19 vaccines cause people to become magnetized such that metal objects stick to their bodies. Condom-associated erection problem (CAEP) is erectile dysfunction experienced due to condoms. CAEP can occur in young and healthy men who otherwise have no erectile dysfunctions, although men who experience CAEP have greater odds of having mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction. 
‼️”all covid-19 vaccines cause deadly blood clots...travel to the brain, heart, lungs & other organs, causing strokes, heart attacks (rapper DMX was killed this way), pulmonary embolisms...&other...none of which...officially listed as "vaccine" deaths” https://t.co/joO5hAIfWV [SEP] There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). For higher age groups the benefit to risk ratio increased.Also on 7 April 2021, an interim statement from the WHO said its advisory body, GACVS, found any "causal relationship" between the rare blood clot cases and AZD1222 to be "plausible but is not confirmed".On 20 April 2021, the safety committee of the EMA (PRAC) found a "possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets" for the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine; and required that these rare events, similar to those noted for AZD1222, should be listed as a very rare side effect. Syndrome identification
A number of COVID‑19 vaccines began to become approved and available at scale in December 2020, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up at scale from the beginning of 2021, among them the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, based on an adenovirus vector and internally termed AZD1222.On 11 March 2021, the EMA issued a statement noting Denmark had suspended AZD1222 vaccinations due to a vaccinated patient dying with blood clots. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)". In the United States, pulmonary embolisms are the primary cause of at least 10,000 to 12,000 deaths per year and a contributing cause in at least 30,000 to 40,000 deaths per year. Some may occur in the brain, causing a stroke, or in the heart, causing a heart attack. 
"Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may directly cause psychiatric morbidity through cerebral infection or hyperinflammation [2]. Recovery in Long COVID is multi-faceted and we recommend mental health ". [SEP] There is increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19 causes both acute and chronic neurological or psychological symptoms. Chronic COVID-19 neurologic symptoms
A study of 236,379 COVID-19 survivors showed that the "estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months" after diagnosed infection was 33.62% with 12.84% "receiving their first such diagnosis" and higher risks being associated with COVID-19 severity.Neuroinflammation as a result of viral infection (e.g., influenza, herpes simplex, and hepatitis C) has been linked to the onset of psychiatric illness across numerous publications. Excess inflammation following a COVID-19 infection can alter neurotransmitter signaling which contributes to development of psychotic and mood related disorders.A large study showed that post COVID-19, people had increased risk of several neurologic sequelae including headache, memory problems, smell problems and stroke; the risk was evident even among people whose acute disease was not severe enough to necessitate hospitalization; the risk was higher among hospitalized, and highest among those who needed ICU care during the acute phase of the infection. There have been case reports of acute psychiatric disturbance and attempted suicide in the context of acute COVID-19 infection. Chronic COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms
A 2021 article published in Nature reports increased risk of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and substance use disorders among post-acute COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people across the globe. Together, these findings suggest that COVID-19 may increase psychiatric sequelae, and those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions may be at increased risk for COVID-19. Those admitted to the ICU while battling their direct infection of the COVID-19 virus experience mental health consequences as a result of this stay, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. 
No theoretical reason to believe COVID vaccine will cause harm to pregnant mothers or unborn child. https://t.co/xHtWkeGhKb [SEP] COVID-19 infection in pregnancy is associated with several pregnancy complications. Effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis in 2021, COVID-19 is associated with stillbirth, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy
COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. Before COVID-19 vaccines were available, pregnant women who caught the disease were at increased risk of needing intensive care, invasive ventilation or ECMO, but not at increased risk of death. Infection significantly increased the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and pre-eclampsia.COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and associated with improved levels of risk for stillbirth, premature birth and admission of the newborn to intensive care. Gynecologist and medical columnist Jen Gunter stated none of the vaccines currently approved in the United States "can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy". Vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue
In November 2020, claims circulated on the web that the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contained tissue from aborted fetuses. 
 Even Fauci the Gates mouthpiece admits masks do not protect you. Btw corona can get in your eyes, through cloth, on your clothes etc. The mask can recirculate bacteria in your body, affect your immune system, double your co2 intake, cause lung infections etc. Individual choice. [SEP] Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.Reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against COVID-19. Face shields and eye protection
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend the use of face shields as a substitute for masks to help slow the spread of COVID-19. (7 January 2021) funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, part of the CDC, face shields were found to block very few cough aerosols in contrast to face coverings – such as cloth masks, procedure masks, and N95 respirators – indicating that face shields are not effective as source control devices for small respiratory aerosols and that face coverings are more effective than face shields as source control devices to reduce the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.In a scoping review, Godoy et al. In April 2020, the WHO acknowledged that wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases including COVID-19 but claimed that medical masks would create a false sense of security and neglect of other necessary measures, such as hand hygiene.The early WHO advice on limited mask usage was scrutinized for several reasons. United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Early in 2020, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it did not recommend the use of face masks for the general public. In August 2020, the CDC added that exhalation valves or vents in masks do not help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others.In a November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC reiterated their recommendation for the community use of masks and specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Recommendations
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that cloth face masks should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus. Effectiveness
Cloth face masks can be used for source control to reduce disease transmission arising from the wearer's respiratory droplets, but are not considered personal protective equipment for the wearer as they typically have very low filter efficiency. 
  All vaccines have side effects and in a small % of cases even cause death  The chances of getting/dying from polio were higher than from the Vaccine. So it made sense to take the jab  When it comes to Covid, more children will be hospitalised/die from the vaccine than from Covid [SEP] Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. It is widely accepted that the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization. According to a June 2022 study, COVID‑19 vaccinations prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. Polio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio). Poliovirus Vaccines at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Immunization with OPV was found to reduce all-cause childhood mortality  even in the absence of wild poliovirus circulation, hospital admission rate, incidence of bacterial diarrhea, and otitis media. There are rare incidents of disease transmission and/or of paralytic polio associated with the attenuated oral vaccine and for this reason the injected vaccine is preferred. Polio vaccine as a claimed COVID-19 carrier
Social media posts in Cameroon pushed a conspiracy theory that polio vaccines contained COVID-19, further complicating polio eradication beyond the logistical and funding difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prior receipt of 2008–09 TIV (Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine) was associated with an increased risk of medically attended pH1N1 illness during the spring-summer 2009 in Canada. With mortality ranging between 25 – 30% and lifelong consequences between 16 – 30% it was one of the most severe adverse events associated with this vaccination. Incidence
Vaccination with vaccinia virus was accompanied with a spectrum of adverse events. Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. DIC may cause a range of symptoms, including abnormal bleeding, breathlessness, chest pain, neurological symptoms, low blood pressure, or swelling.COVID‑19 vaccines have some adverse effects that are listed as common in the two or three days following vaccination which are usually mild and temporary. As CVSTs are more likely in women using hormonal contraceptives, this inherent risk factor may be an influence on the reported preponderance of women experiencing these events following vaccination. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects".

23. The claim that only (severe) #Covid_19 but not influenza may cause venous thrombosis and pulmonary (lung) embolism is not true, as it has been known for 50 years that severe influenza greatly increases the risk of thrombosis and embolism, too. [SEP] Influenza may progress to pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus or by a subsequent bacterial infection. A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID.Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. Influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like H1N1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like H5N1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious. In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm. Neurological complications have been associated with influenza on rare occasions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. While sometimes confused with the common cold, influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus. 
A CDC panel says administering Johnson & Johnson shots would save many lives. It could cause about 24 cases of a rare and dangerous clotting disorder, but prevent 1,435 COVID-19 deaths, a CDC staffer and an analysis suggested. https://t.co/k49KoeeWfB [SEP] The purpose of this 15-member advisory panel is to educate consumers about the risks and benefits of drugs, devices and vaccines.

    Exactly but its daft to put yourself in a position where in future life you could be classed as having a chronic illness  from a virus which is highly likely to cause some damage which would put you in a high risk category. you have the chance to protect yourself. Up to you !!! [SEP] Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of COVID-19 developing to a serious illness. Risk of severe illness
The NHS of the United Kingdom has warned that those undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer and those with bone marrow cancers are vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19. ESMO also recommends advising patients on infection control.The NHS in England stresses that individual patient decisions have to be made by multidisciplinary teams. The possibility has been raised, but needs to be investigated further, that patients with long COVID-19  may be predisposed to the development of lung cancer. Weight loss decreases these risks. In epidemiology, a risk factor or determinant is a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection. For example, being young cannot be said to cause measles, but young people have a higher rate of measles because they are less likely to have developed immunity during a previous epidemic. For this reason, airlines place restrictions on the travel of passengers with known airborne contagious diseases (e.g. 
It’s still unknown how the vaccine could cause blood clots. One potential explanation is that some people develop an immune response that attacks platelets, making them clump together, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine tied to uncommon blood clots, experts.  https://t.co/peLyu8wX25 [SEP] Causes
The rare simultaneous occurrence of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) with blood clots after vaccination raised the original concern about this condition. There is no confirmed causal link to the syndrome and any COVID‑19 vaccination, however EMA is conducting investigations into AZD1222 and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) for possible causal links.On 7 April 2021, the EMA noted one "plausible explanation" for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is "an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in people treated with heparin", that is heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

She went on to say "The PRAC after a very in-depth analysis has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine". The EMA also initiated an assessment for all COVID‑19 vaccines used in the EU for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), described as low blood platelet levels that could lead to bruising and bleeding, as a possible side effect, whilst also stating that up to this point no link with any COVID‑19 had been established.On 7 April 2021, the EMA determined that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of AZD1222, with WHO and UK EHRA issuing generally similar statements on the same day.

 Truly sorry to hear for your loss. However, the vaccination is NOT safe. It will not save you and will cause problems to your body. FDA has not yet approved any of Covid vaccines but said can be used for emergency purposes. There is a big difference. I do not trust the vaccine. [SEP] According to a June 2022 study published in The Lancet, COVID-19 vaccination in the United States prevented an additional 1.9 million deaths from December 8, 2020, to December 8, 2021. Adverse effects
Vaccinations given to children, adolescents, or adults are generally safe. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective, it prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". Studies are underway to gauge efficacy and safety in children aged 0–11 (KidCOVE) and 12–17 (TeenCOVE).A further study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between December 2020, and March 2021, on nearly 4 thousand health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers concluded that under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (14 days or more after second dose) was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections, regardless of symptoms, and vaccine effectiveness of partial immunization (14 days or more after first dose but before second dose) was 80%.The duration of protection provided by the vaccine is unknown as of April 2021, and a two-year followup study is underway to determine the duration.Preliminary results from a phase III trial indicate that vaccine efficacy is durable, remaining at 93% six months after the second dose. Studies in animals found no safety concerns and clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines in pregnant women. Safety
Vaccine development and approval
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently. The U.S. Alzheimer's Association has stated that currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. 
    COVID attacks the lungs which causes inflammation, especially with people suffering from NCD's. The body responds to inflammation with a cykotine response, which causes, and I quote, significant changes in motor activity and motivation as well as anxiety, arousal, and alarm" [SEP] In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines binding their cognate receptor on immune cells results in activation and stimulation of further cytokine production. Additionally, as a soluble cytokine blockade, it will not increase serum levels of GM-CSF (a phenomenon seen with tocilizumab and IL-6).Although frequently used to treat severe CRS in people with ARDS, corticosteroids and NSAIDs have been evaluated in clinical trials and have shown no effect on lung mechanics, gas exchange, or beneficial outcome in early established ARDS. The viruses can invade lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to produce viral nucleic acid, which stimulates the infected cells to release cytokines and chemokines, activating macrophages, dendritic cells, and others.Cytokine storm syndrome is a diverse set of conditions that can result in a cytokine storm. Relationship to COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors have attributed many deaths to cytokine storms. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune system resulting in a release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6, which can increase vascular permeability and cause a migration of fluid and blood cells into the alveoli leading to such consequent symptoms as dyspnea and respiratory failure. Additionally, postmortem examination of patients with COVID-19 has shown a large accumulation of inflammatory cells in lung tissues including macrophages and T-helper cells.Early recognition of a cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is crucial to ensure the best outcome for recovery, allowing  treatment with a variety of biological agents that target the cytokines to reduce their levels. Short-term use of dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, has been demonstrated to reduce the severity of inflammation and lung damage induced by a cytokine storm by inhibiting the severe cytokine storm or the hyperinflammatory phase in patients with COVID-19.Clinical trials continue to identify causes of cytokine storms in COVID-19 cases. 
 Yes, I'm doing the same, watching other countries. I have a rare autoimmune disease + take various immunosuppressants as my body is always fighting its own immune system. Understanding how Covid19 can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response resulting in a Cytokine storm /... [SEP] In immunology, cryptic self epitopes are a source of autoimmunity. "How can cryptic epitopes trigger autoimmunity?". Cytokine receptors are receptors that bind to cytokines.In recent years, the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves, partly because of their remarkable characteristics, and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states. Soluble cytokine receptors are extremely common regulators of cytokine function. There is compelling evidence that autoimmunity against this class of G protein-coupled receptors results in a variety of pathologies:
Cardiovascular diseases and events:
Circulating autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors have been identified in numerous heart diseases and cardiac symptoms. Cardiomyopathy due to autoimmune dysregulation and production of autoantibodies has been seen in humans and reproduced in animal models. Current research is trying to determine the exact role of these autoantibodies and whether they correlate with the symptomatology of Chagas disease.Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome
The Heart Rhythm Institute at the University of Oklahoma points to an autoimmune basis in a condition that presents as chronic malfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The identification of these antibodies and the development of better testing provide hope for more targeted therapies and better treatment outcomes. 
  Pneumonia and bronchitis are inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria or viruses, including the virus which causes COVID. So your statement really doesn't make much sense as pneumonia and bronchitis are both possible symptoms of COVID. [SEP] Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs. Fever and other systemic symptoms are rare in acute bronchitis; their presence raises suspicion for influenza or pneumonia. Cause
Acute bronchitis can be caused by contagious pathogens, most commonly viruses. The severity of the condition is variable.Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia. Classification
Pneumonitis refers to lung inflammation; pneumonia refers to pneumonitis, usually due to infection but sometimes non-infectious, that has the additional feature of pulmonary consolidation. Acute bronchitis is normally caused by a viral infection. 
Covid-19 vaccines initiates an early and progressive clotting of blood in the lungs (pulmonary thrombosis) which impairs blood supply and gas exchange at lungs, leading to respiratory failure, which in majority of cases cause death. [SEP] Post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), or vaccine-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VATT), are rare types of blood clotting syndromes that were initially observed in a number of people who had previously received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine (AZD1222) during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Signs and symptoms
The thrombosis events associated with the COVID‑19 vaccine may occur 4–28 days after its administration and mainly affects women under 55. DIC may cause a range of symptoms, including abnormal bleeding, breathlessness, chest pain, neurological symptoms, low blood pressure, or swelling.COVID‑19 vaccines have some adverse effects that are listed as common in the two or three days following vaccination which are usually mild and temporary. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID‑19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects". None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. The study included 294 participants who presented with symptoms of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after receipt of the first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, showing an independent association between baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage.

Up to half of hospitalized COVID patients have elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, or antibodies that cause blood clots to form. Patients with these antibodies are much more likely to have severe respiratory disease and kidney injury. #COVID19 [SEP] Signs and symptoms
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy-related complications does not indicate APS (see below for the diagnosis of APS). Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. Clinically important antiphospholipid antibodies (those that arise as a result of the autoimmune process) are associated with thrombosis and vascular disease. Anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with thrombosis at moderate to high titres (over 40 GPLU or MPLU). Patients with both lupus anticoagulant antibodies and moderate or high titre anticardiolipin antibodies show a greater risk of thrombosis than with one alone.The increased risks of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth by antiphospholipid antibodies, as supported by in vitro studies, include decreased trophoblast viability, syncytialization and invasion, deranged production of hormones and signalling molecules by trophoblasts, as well as activation of coagulation and complement pathways. The syndrome is caused by antiphospholipid antibodies that target a group of proteins in the body that are associated with phospholipids. These antibodies activate endothelial cells, platelets, and immune cells, ultimately causing a large inflammatory immune response and widespread clotting. Investigators speculate that the antibodies interfere with phospholipids used to induce in vitro coagulation. 
   Along those same lines, if my loved one dies straight after getting a covid vaccination, can I get the hospital to state the cause of death was the vaccine?  If it's good for COVID then it must be good for the vaccines as well?   #COVID19Aus #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine #uspol [SEP] If a person acquires a vaccine-preventable disease and dies from it, the death is considered a vaccine-preventable death.The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) are: diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b infection, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, tetanus, tuberculosis, and yellow fever. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus.The Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing illness and deaths from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines.Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. Available evidence indicates that the level of protection may not be the same for all variants of the virus.As of December 2021, there are no FDA-authorized or approved tests that providers or the public can use to determine if a person is protected from infection reliably.As of March 2022, elderly residents' protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death in English care homes was high immediately after vaccination, but protection declined significantly in the months following vaccination. While killed vaccines do not have this risk, they cannot generate specific killer T cell responses and may not work at all for some diseases.Second generation vaccines were developed to reduce the risks from live vaccines. Once critically ill, some have changed their minds and shared their stories on social media as a warning".The Washington Post noted that "[t]he narrative is even more potent when the victim expresses a dying wish for others to get vaccinated, and regrets their decision not to". Whether reporting of these deaths actually encourages opponents of vaccination to change their position is unclear, but it has been asserted that proponents of vaccination "have expressed thanks for providing a record of anti-vaccine deaths that have helped them convince skeptics to get the shots". The term "vaccine failure" does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is defective. Safety
Vaccine development and approval
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently. 
Chronic stress could cause problems for your baby. These can include effects on your unborn baby’s growth and the length of gestation.[NEWLINE]#healthdisparities #blacklivesmatter #covid #publichealth #health #socialdeterminantsofhealth #healthequity https://t.co/4JgSKue9tQ [SEP] Maternal stress
Maternal stress has been linked to a number of negative outcomes for the developing fetus. Because of a link in blood supply between a mother and fetus, it has been found that stress can leave lasting effects on a developing fetus, even before a child is born. Additionally, persistent antenatal stress experienced toward the end of the gestation period is shown to inflict severe and permanent damage on the foetus’ physiological development, potentially leading to early growth retardation, aka intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labour and delayed motor development in infancy.Studying the foetal stress response in vivo is not commonly done due to various ethical considerations, but the few studies which have managed to conduct research into this phenomenon during a human pregnancy have reached similar conclusions. This psychosocial or physical stress that the expectant mother is experiencing has an effect on the fetus. found that prenatal psychosocial stress can cause delays in child growth and development through assessing the child's weight, height and head circumference every two months after they were born. Prenatal stress can increase the likelihood of maternal and endocrinological problems. Furthermore, prenatal stress can have an effect on fetal development by causing obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other problems. Stress on the mother during pregnancy can lead to issues in cognitive development, social development and more. 
 I've heard heart disease and cancer death tolls down 50-60% because if patient tested positive for Covid 19, Covid 19 was reported as their cause of death.  Is this true? [SEP] The CDC estimates that, between February 2020 and September 2021, only 1 in 1.3 COVID-19 deaths were attributed to COVID-19. By April 25, the U.S. had more than 905,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 52,000 deaths, giving it a mortality rate around 5.7 percent. > 6,000,000 positive test individuals
2,000,000–6,000,000 positive test individuals
1,000,000–2,000,000 positive test individuals
400,000–1,000,000 positive test individuals
<400,000 positive test individuals
Death projections
On March 31, 2020, the CDC projected that eventually 100,000–240,000 Americans would die of coronavirus. In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic ranks first on the list of disasters in the United States by death toll; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020, and life expectancy continued to fall from 2020 to 2021.On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. It mostly consists of hospital deaths, but also includes COVID-19-positive deaths in care homes and the community that are reported by the health service. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency gives a higher death toll, as it also counts "suspected cases" where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate but no test was done.The statistics below run from when COVID-19 was first detected in Northern Ireland until 31 March 2022. 
Fact: The COVID-19 vaccine will NOT give you #COVID19. None of the vaccines currently in development or use in the U.S. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. But, as the #vaccine helps you build #immunity, the process can sometimes cause symptoms, such as a fever. https://t.co/SJV4eGWDAj [SEP] A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. Viral vector vaccines were also developed for the COVID‑19 pandemic after the technology was previously cleared for Ebola.As multiple COVID‑19 vaccines have been authorized or licensed for use, real-world vaccine effectiveness (RWE) is being assessed using case control and observational studies. Adverse events
For most people, the side effects, also called adverse effects, from COVID‑19 vaccines are mild and can be managed at home. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other vaccines, and severe adverse effects are rare. Neurological side effects from getting COVID-19 are hundreds of times more likely than from vaccination.Documented rare serious effects include:

anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against myocarditis due to subsequent COVID-19 infection. Among the COVID-19 vaccines are a number of RNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and some have been approved or have received emergency use authorization in some countries. 
     Let's all get one thing straight:  The virus in question is a beta-coronavirus called SARS-COV-2. It itself is a variant of SARS-COV, and related to MERS-COV.  The virus is claimed to cause a recognized (yet disputed) list of symptoms. This list is known as COVID-19. [SEP] There are many variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Beta variant, (B.1.351), was a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Phylogenetics and taxonomy
SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus.In July 2020, scientists reported that a more infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 variant with spike protein variant G614 has replaced D614 as the dominant form in the pandemic.Coronavirus genomes and subgenomes encode six open reading frames (ORFs). Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV or SARS-CoV) is a species of virus consisting of many known strains phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) that have been shown to possess the capability to infect humans, bats, and certain other mammals. The SARSr-CoV species is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (SARS Betacoronavirus).Two strains of the virus have caused outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), which caused the 2002–2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. 
“Patients brought into hospital with heart attack symptoms have later been found to be suffering from cardiac inflammation caused by the virus...it can begin as a kidney infection, or as meningitis, before going on to cause respiratory problems.” #COVID19  https://t.co/tlVDUjp8Q8 [SEP] Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest.Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. While myocarditis may develop over periods ranging from hours to months, patients typically present with signs and symptoms that resemble heart failure, including the following:
Since myocarditis is often due to a viral illness, many patients experience symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection including a fever, rash, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pains, and easily becoming tired. Overall, myocarditis can be caused by infections, immune conditions, toxins, drug reactions, and physical injuries to the heart. The mechanism by which coxsackie B viruses (CBVs) trigger inflammation is believed to be through the recognition of CBV virions by Toll-like receptors.The binding of many types of coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, through ACE2 receptors present in heart muscle may be responsible for direct viral injury leading to myocarditis. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that Covid-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs). Diagnosis
Myocarditis refers to an underlying process that causes inflammation and injury of the heart. Myocarditis and COVID-19
Myocarditis can be seen during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; with the myocarditis being associated with a spectrum of severities from asymptomatic to fulminant. 
 Polio vaccine underwent the largest clinical trial for its time.  COVID passed through the EUA process.   Science is telling us two of the vaccines cause blood clots.  People are allowed to make logical judgements on what they do or dont put in their body. [SEP] Regulatory status
According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as of 28 March 2021, the reported number of cases of embolic and thrombotic events after vaccination is lower than the rate of such events in the general population overall. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective, it prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. The EMA states the overall risk-benefit for the Janssen vaccine remains positive.On 16 December 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should be preferred over the Janssen vaccine, following growing concerns about rare blood clots. Syndrome identification
A number of COVID‑19 vaccines began to become approved and available at scale in December 2020, with vaccinations beginning to ramp up at scale from the beginning of 2021, among them the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine, based on an adenovirus vector and internally termed AZD1222.On 11 March 2021, the EMA issued a statement noting Denmark had suspended AZD1222 vaccinations due to a vaccinated patient dying with blood clots. While noting there had been reports of other vaccinated people having blood clots and that its safety committee is already reviewing such cases, the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than in the general population.The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on 19 March 2021, issued a statement relating to safety signals related to AZD1222 relating to thromboembolic events and thrombocytopenia following review of available data and conclusions included that AZD1222 "a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world".In its safety update of 29 March 2021, the EMA indicated it had initiated investigations into the very rare cases of specific embolic and thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets) and related bleeding including disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), noting any link with AZD1222 is not proven but could not be excluded. None of the agencies found a confirmed causal link between the vaccine and these incidents at the time, but were listing them out of an abundance of caution.A highlight of minutes of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluding 9 April 2021, indicating they also were investigating four cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, including one death, amongst people who had taken the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine. The clinical trial is ongoing and is set to conclude in late 2022.Pregnant and breastfeeding women were also excluded from the initial trials used to obtain the emergency use authorization, though trials in those populations were expected to be performed in 2021.On 16 March 2021, in order to increase the span of vaccination beyond adults, Moderna started the clinical trials of vaccines on children age 6-months to 11-years-old in the US and in Canada (KidCove),
in addition to the existing and fully-enrolled study on 12-17 year-olds (TeenCOVE). A vaccine trial is a clinical trial that aims at establishing the safety and efficacy of a vaccine prior to it being licensed.A vaccine candidate drug is first identified through preclinical evaluations that could involve high throughput screening and selecting the proper antigen to invoke an immune response. 
I know no system is perfect, so I share this with that in mind - Getting #COVID in #EmergencyRooms - I found only one small study that says low risk.  More #research needs to be done, as this was the cause in my family! [NEWLINE]I beg to differ! [NEWLINE]https://t.co/HEeEWQyH75 https://t.co/AXWgzLhwWD [SEP] COVID-19 pandemic
On 11 March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is yet to be investigated what COVID-19 control measures are most efficient controlling virus spread and least socioeconomic impact.According to the World Health Organization, more than 80% of individuals living in cities are typically exposed to dangerous air pollution, which has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 problems and mortality.The changes in air pollution during COVID lockdowns have also impacted water quality. Most studies have found that improvements due to COVID-19 were temporary, although there have been notable decreases in pollutants in various water systems. The purpose of the project was to determine the community prevalence of COVID-19 and ultimately aimed to both lower the risk and slow the spread of the virus. While the treated water was safe for drinking and other uses, the wastewater from the treatment facilities that drained into rivers or seas could still have some SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but it was too low to be detected which proved it to be unlikely. No other water source had detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which led scientists of this experiment to see no prominent harm done from the pandemic on the water quality in South Africa. At the time of testing, reports claimed that only 750 citizens were infected with COVID-19, but actual wastewater contamination showed a larger percentage of the population infected. The World Health Organization and UNICEF strongly recommended sanitary hand washing facilities to be the bare minimum for fighting COVID-19 and suggested that lack of access to these necessary facilities (for over 74 million people in the Arab regions) was responsible for putting people at very high risk of contracting COVID-19.In some undeveloped countries, water utilities have worked with governments to temporarily suspend billing for vulnerable groups. 
   The 10,000 deaths are those caused by Covid alone, excluding anyone who may have had cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure or any other number of preexisting conditions.  The 200,000 is a real number that is still climbing.  Time to re-educate yourself. [SEP] In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. May to August 2020
By May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. By September 20, COVID-19 had killed over 675,000 Americans, the estimated number of American deaths from the Spanish flu in 1918. This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.The number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.

Stop calling it a vaccine!! Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick. Covid shot doesnt [SEP] A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented completely.The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Types
Vaccines typically contain attenuated, inactivated or dead organisms or purified products derived from them. There are several types of vaccines in use. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case for prescription drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. Most vaccines consist of viruses that have been attenuated, disabled, weakened or killed in some way so that their virulent properties are no longer effective. 
   Btw- it’s driving me bonkers that people are acting like the pandemic is over.. variants, how long the vaccine is effective is concerning, breakthrough cases in the vaccinated. Even Asymptotic covid can cause long term problems! [SEP] COVID-19 and variant related claims
Prevalent COVID-19 skepticism
Prior to the vaccine launch many citizens expressed skepticism that COVID-19 was a serious disease or that their countries had cases or high number of cases of the disease during 2020 and 2021. We've lost so many people to COVID. As of June 2023, COVID-19 is a pandemic, but it could become endemic in a future phase. The observed behavior of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, suggests it is unlikely it will die out, and the lack of a COVID-19 vaccine that provides long-lasting immunity against infection means it cannot immediately be eradicated; thus, a future transition to an endemic phase appears probable. Precisely what would constitute an endemic phase is contested.On May 5, 2023, the World Health Organization ended the public health emergency of international concern regarding COVID-19, but still considered the outbreak to be a pandemic. The report said endemicity could give rise to a new pandemic of long COVID that would cause significant strain on nations' economies and healthcare systems because of the health and social care required to treat people.As of March 2023, it was not possible to predict the infection patterns COVID-19 would settle on, though as with other coronaviruses it seemed possible the pattern would not be a seasonal one of the kind seen with influenza.On 5 May 2023, the WHO declared that the pandemic was no longer a public health emergency of international concern, though continued to refer to it as a pandemic.

   Getting Covid causes your body to make antibodies against the virus (probably more than one type).  The vaccine cause the body to make one very specific antibody.  This mixed immunity is probably very good [SEP] A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). In some cases vaccines may result in partial immune protection (in which immunity is less than 100% effective but still reduces risk of infection) or in temporary immune protection (in which immunity wanes over time) rather than full or permanent immunity. They can also mitigate the severity of infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, faster recovery from illness, and a wide range of other effects.Those who are older often display less of a response than those who are younger, a pattern known as Immunosenescence.Adjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response, particularly for older people whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened.The efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on several factors:

the disease itself (for some diseases vaccination performs better than for others)
the strain of vaccine (some vaccines are specific to, or at least most effective against, particular strains of the disease)
whether the vaccination schedule has been properly observed. There are several types of vaccines in use. Other contents
Adjuvants
Vaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. Other vaccines, including those for COVID-19, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected. For instance, a person who is vaccinated for influenza not only protects themselves from the risk of influenza, but simultaneously also prevents themselves from infecting those around them. 
   No you cannot get sticker from wearing your mask. It says that if you have moderate to severe asthma that covid-19 can exacerbate things and possibly cause pneumonia [SEP] Although cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the clearance of C. pneumoniae, this response can be harmful to the host because it favours the development of inflammation that can lead to asthma. In fact, the severity of asthma can be determined by the elevated titres to C. pneumoniae, but not to other potential pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus. Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that C. pneumoniae plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process. Its antigenic stimulation strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs. Furthermore, infection with C. pneumonia also induces serum immunoglobulin IgA, and IgG responses, which are associated with chronic asthma. This is because the increase of cytokine production results in a continuing inflammatory response in the airway, followed by negative effects such as immunopathological tissue damage and scarring as described in the C. pneumonia’s role in asthma section. To support this statement, asthmatic subjects that are infected with rhinovirus have demonstrated an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness, airway obstruction, and inflammation. Masks or face coverings are worn to reduce the virus breathed out by an infected person (who may not know they are infected), as well as the virus breathed in by a susceptible person. 
    Zitat aus obigem Artikel: „But there’s no evidence currently that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune disease or make it worse... . At the moment there’s every reason to suggest that people with autoimmune diseases ought to get either of these vaccines when they get rolled out.”“ [SEP] They are also referred to as cell-mediated immune (CMI) vaccines.It is thought that they can be more effective than conventional B-cell vaccines for protection from microbes that hide inside host cells, and viruses (such as HIV or influenza) that mutate rapidly.T-cell vaccines underwent clinical trials for HIV/AIDS.As of July 2012 none have been approved.As December 2020, The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab passed the FDA's emergency use authorization  and became the first FDA authorized T cell vaccine.

Research suggests an overall correlation between autoimmune diseases and cancer, in that having an autoimmune disease increases the risk of developing certain cancers. Autoimmune diseases cause inflammation in various ways, but the particular cause of inflammation does not greatly affect cancer risk. This suggests that the benefits of infection resistance outweigh the risk of autoimmune diseases, which is not surprising given the high risk of infection during most of human history.Other examples

Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which pancreatic β-cells are targeted and destroyed by the immune system. Analysis of large cohort data shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) is linked to a substantially increased risk of developing a diverse new-onset autoimmune diseases. This shows that there has been an increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in recent years pointing to a stronger influence of environment factors as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases. A deficiency in vitamin D, from hereditary or environmental influence, can lead to a more inefficient and weaker immune response and seen as a contributing factor to the development of autoimmune diseases. 
  If it's unclear it can't be reported.  The death has to be contributed from Covid because Covid causes the respiratory issues etc that cause the death, Covid caused it.  Like lung cancer if death because their lung stopped functioning because of cancer they died from lung cancer. [SEP] In the United States, the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 103,436,829 confirmed cases with 1,127,152 all-time deaths, the most of any country, and the 20th-highest per capita worldwide. These effects persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020, and life expectancy continued to fall from 2020 to 2021.On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. On February 6, the earliest confirmed American death with COVID-19 (that of a 57-year-old woman) occurred in Santa Clara County, California. The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21, by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County. As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history. This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.The number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.

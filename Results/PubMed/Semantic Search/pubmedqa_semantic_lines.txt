   Many of the covid vaccines are more likely to cause side effects compared to your normal flu shot. Here is the data for 1st and 2nd doses.   Side effects don't mean it's bad for you. It means it's working. That's how the immune system works.  Source:  https://t.co/hFv7q9slPh https://t.co/2LjZ6lXmrV [SEP] anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare but do occur, and have been reported for nearly every vaccine. adverse reactions to vaccines are generally mild; severe events resulting in death or permanent damage are rare. like other drugs, vaccines can cause adverse events, but unlike conventional medicines, which are prescribed to people who are ill, vaccines are administered to healthy individuals, thus increasing the concern over adverse reactions. most side effects attributed to vaccines are mild, acute and transient; however, rare reactions such as hypersensitivity, induction of infection, and autoimmunity do occur and can be severe and even fatal. severe immunologically mediated reactions are rare and less common with the vaccine than the true infection. in this paper, we perform a systematic literature search and narrative review of immune-mediated vaccine adverse events and their known and proposed mechanisms, and outline directions for future research. vaccine components may contribute to inflammatory, allergic or anaphylactic reactions. the evaluation of many vaccinations at present varies between two extremes: on the one hand vaccination procedures are considered to provide an opportunity to eradicate most of the infectious diseases, on the other hand there is a tendency to assess side effects more drastically the more likely the danger of the particular disease seems eliminated once and for all. however, seemingly inexplicit adverse reactions have been described after the injection of the newer vaccines vs. human papillomavirus (hpv). adverse reactions appear to be more frequent after hpv vaccination when compared to other type of immunizations. 
 The S1 spike protein used in the Covid vaccine may be toxic to endothelial cells. Likely the cause of the clotting problems we are seeing from people who get the vaccine.  https://t.co/ZCepuEfWCD [SEP] the coronavirus (cov) spike (s) protein is critical for receptor binding, membrane fusion and internalization of the virus into the human cells. vaccination, particularly for pertussis, has been implicated as a direct cause of an encephalopathy with refractory seizures and intellectual impairment. the spike (s) proteins of covs are surface glycoproteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells via attachment to their respective cellular receptors. the s protein is believed to be a major immunogenic component of covs and a target for neutralizing antibodies (nabs) and most candidate vaccines. here, we review the reasons why anti-cd20 therapy may abrogate or diminish the efficacy of a vaccine against sars-cov-2 and we draw physicians' attention towards this potential risk so that it can be considered when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio of anti-cd20 therapy during the current pandemic. the magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. the spike glycoprotein of the sars-cov-2 virus, which causes covid-19, has attracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cell surface receptors. developing effective and safe vaccines is urgently needed to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-associated coronavirus (sars-cov). the inactivated sars-cov vaccine may be the first one available for clinical use because it is easy to generate; however, safety is the main concern. the spike (s) protein of sars-cov is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, and the receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the s1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. 
  And the Covid vaccine can’t knock out all the variants either.   So once again, we are taking a vaccine with known risks that STILL doesn’t let us leave our basements or take off our double masks. But it does cause blood clots, so there’s that. [SEP] the eradication of smallpox (variola) and the subsequent cessation of routine vaccination have left modern society vulnerable to bioterrorism employing this devastating contagious disease. the existing, licensed vaccines based on live vaccinia virus (vacv) are contraindicated for a substantial number of people, and prophylactic vaccination of large populations is not reasonable when there is little risk of exposure. the licensed smallpox vaccine, comprised of infectious vaccinia, is no longer popular as it is associated with a variety of adverse events. knowledge about the pathogenic potential of individual strains in the varicella vaccine is limited. the current live vaccinia virus vaccine used in the prevention of smallpox is contraindicated for millions of immune-compromised individuals. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. the administration of vaccines is not usually recommended in pregnant women because of a fear of severe adverse events for the fetus. traditional replicating smallpox vaccines are associated with serious safety concerns in the general population and are contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals. however, this very population remains at greatest risk for severe complications following viral infections, making vaccine prevention particularly relevant. this policy places contacts at risk of paralysis from an untested, unlicensed "spread virus" vaccine and places infants at risk for an unproven, theoretical benefit to others, not themselves. 
4. Vaccines have other heavy metals along with nano particles that are excellent conductors for frequencies being beamed down. The reason chronically ill have most covid deaths b/c severe Gut damage is cause of most chronic illness, allowing particles into blood stream... [SEP] vaccines activate suitable immune responses to fight against diseases but can possess limitations such as compromised efficacy and immunogenic responses, poor stability, and requirement of adherence to multiple doses. various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. the various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development and their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. this review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines. additionally, we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with peptide vaccines. vaccines have been used for over 200 years and are the most effective way of preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with infections. safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness are paramount to vaccine development. vaccines play an essential role in controlling the rates of fatality and morbidity. vaccines not only arrest the beginning of different diseases but also assign a gateway for its elimination and reduce toxicity. 
 People literally believe that the world is flat, 5G networks caused covid and that vaccines cause autism. This is par for the course… [SEP] one-fifth of global mortality, especially in children under the age of five is due to infectious diseases. poliovirus causes paralytic poliomyelitis, an ancient disease of humans that became a major public-health issue in the 20th century. it is suspected that web 2.0 web sites, with a lot of user-generated content, often support viewpoints that link autism to vaccines. we assessed the prevalence of the views supporting a link between vaccines and autism online by comparing youtube, google and wikipedia with pubmed. support for a link between vaccines and autism is most prominent on youtube, followed by google search results. anti-vaccine activists use scientific arguments, certified physicians and official-sounding titles to gain credibility, while also leaning on celebrity endorsement and personalized stories. online communities with greater freedom of speech lead to a dominance of anti-vaccine voices. all vaccine groups had similar levels of il-2. we examined the expected experience of normal individuals from a hypothetical birth cohort of 3.5 million persons followed from birth to their 30th birthday without and with a varicella vaccination programme. if the major assumptions in this analysis hold true, there may be substantial financial benefits from vaccinating all children against varicella. 
   That makes no sense.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If they have done so much work already why have they never got rid of the common cold.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid is noting like any other virus. Which other virus causes hair loss, skin irritations and lasts 6-12 months in people?  Only one thing does that.  Radiation!!! [SEP] treatment of norovirus infection is still mysterious because there is no effective antiviral drugs or vaccine developed to protect against the infection, to eradicate the infection an effective vaccine should be developed. it was shown many years ago that viruses can cause common cold but it is often forgotten that there were prolonged investigations and disagreements before this was agreed. it wa difficult to detect or propagate any virus in the laboratory and it has taken more than two decades of research to arrive at a reasonably complete list of the viruses that cause colds and related diseases. the common cold affects millions of people. more than 200 virus strains have been implicated in common colds, thereby thwarting vaccination efforts. the common cold is an acute illness of the upper respiratory tract caused by a virus acquired from another person. some viruses that produce colds are capable of infecting an individual repeatedly (eg, respiratory syncytial virus); others, with many serotypes (eg, rhinovirus), infect only once. the sustained epidemic of colds that occurs annually during september through april is explained by successive waves of different viruses moving through a community. cold symptoms are due to the host's response to the virus rather than to destruction of the nasal mucosa. colds are self-limited illnesses. 
Know the facts! There is no evidence that #COVID19 #vaccines cause #infertility, says   &  https://t.co/c1u4QONH4b #NIAW2021 #InfertilityAwareness [SEP] background: there is currently no effective treatment against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). due to the absence of rct, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific chm intervention for the treatment of patients with covid-19. since the world health organization (who) declared coronavirus infection (covid-19) a public health emergency of international concern in january 2020, there have been many concerns about pregnant women and the possible effects of this emergency with catastrophic outcomes in many countries. the present review provides a brief analysis of covid-19, pregnancy in the covid-19 era, and the effects of covid-19 on pregnancy. we sought to determine if receipt of vaccine containing ph1n1 was associated with spontaneous abortion (sab). this study does not and cannot establish a causal relationship between repeated influenza vaccination and sab, but further research is warranted. however, data on the maternal inflammatory response to vaccination is lacking and would better delineate the safety and clinical utility of immunization. however, further research is needed to confirm that the mild inflammatory response elicited by vaccination is benign in pregnancy. parents who refuse vaccination of their children frequently express concerns about vaccine safety. initial data suggest that overall, pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
  So, they die from lung failure caused by extreme pneumonia or heart failure from sludgy blood but the root cause is #COVID19 (which can be confirmed post-mortem) so the death is counted as due to the #coronavirus & NOT due to “natural” causes of pneumonia or heart attack ... /3 [SEP] the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19), resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus-2 (sars-cov-2) infection, typically leads to respiratory failure in severe cases; however, cardiovascular injury is reported to contribute to a substantial proportion of covid-19 deaths. preexisting cardiovascular disease (cvd) is among the most common risk factors for hospitalization and death in covid-19 patients, and the pathogenic mechanisms of covid-19 disease progression itself may promote the development of cardiovascular injury, increasing risk of in-hospital death. the cause of most deaths has been acute pneumonia. sudden cardiac death in covid-19 patients is not common, but it is a major concern. therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe covid-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin i and inflammatory cytokines. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which primarily targets the human respiratory system and may lead to severe pneumonia and ultimately death. lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in covid-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in covid-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). infection with covid-19 potentially can result in severe outcomes and death from "cytokine storm syndrome", resulting in novel coronavirus pneumonia (ncp) with severe dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), fulminant myocarditis and multiorgan dysfunction with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation. lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in covid-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars- cov-2). 
“It’s unclear if his death was related to the virus.” This is why we perform autopsies. There is a significant likelihood that #COVID19 played a role in that it is known to affect endothelial cells & has been shown to cause neurological symptoms including stroke. https://t.co/FeaX5KMPC4 [SEP] background: emerging evidence shows that coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is commonly complicated by coagulopathy, and venous thromboembolism (vte) is considered to be a potential cause of unexplained death. the presence of covid-19 infection may increase the risk of thrombotic events including ischemic strokes. whilst a number of recent reports suggest that covid-19 associated stroke tends to be severe, there is limited data on the effects of covid-19 in prospective registries. covid-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001), severe disease (nihss >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p = 0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mrs 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p = 0.001). covid-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is characterized by an increased risk of thromboembolic events, with evidence of microthrombosis in the lungs of deceased patients. we report the neuropathological findings of a patient who died from complications of covid-19. neurological complications are common in patients with covid-19. recent observations linked coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) to thromboembolic complications possibly mediated by increased blood coagulability and inflammatory endothelial impairment. synthesized analysis of data from our multicenter study and previously published cohorts indicates that severity of covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of acute stroke. 
  COVID infection can cause a huge drop in sperm counts and infertility. The vaccine has not been associated with this. Vaccine safer than COVID for make fertility. [SEP] after eradication of variola virus the worldwide vaccination program was stopped to avoid the severe complications observed in a small fraction of vaccinees. the existing, licensed vaccines based on live vaccinia virus (vacv) are contraindicated for a substantial number of people, and prophylactic vaccination of large populations is not reasonable when there is little risk of exposure. it may take time to obtain a vaccine for the current covid-19, and the virus genome may keep an evolution and mutations, so a universal and effective vaccine for the coronavirus may not be possible. epidemiological studies reveal the infection of sars and covid-19 in children is less frequent and less severe than in adults. childhood vaccine-mediated cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation might provide protection against the infections of covid-19. these data suggest that herd immunization with children vaccines in adults may improve the adult cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation and improve their clinical presentation and prognosis. covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). might covid-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) breakthrough infections? in contrast to denv, sars and mers covs predominantly infect respiratory epithelium, not macrophages. safe and effective covid-19 vaccines must avoid vah. 
 Severe Covid is a systemic disease not just confined to resp system.. causes hyper inflammation,clotting, encephalopathy etc..we need all hands on deck from generalists to specialists, nurses, ward attendants [SEP] a subgroup of covid-19 patients develop very severe disease with requirement for icu treatment, ventilation, and ecmo therapy. covid-19 is a syndrome that includes more than just isolated respiratory disease, as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) also interacts with the cardiovascular, nervous, renal, and immune system at multiple levels, increasing morbidity in patients with underlying cardiometabolic conditions and inducing myocardial injury or dysfunction. medical staff carry an inordinate risk of infection from patients, and many doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers are affected by covid-19 worldwide. severe covid-19 illness is associated with intense inflammation, leading to high rates of thrombotic complications that increase morbidity and mortality. covid-19 is a complex and heterogeneous disease. the management of hospitalized patients in covid-19 dedicated units is advisable for segregation purpose as well as for infection control. we think that the multidisciplinary involvement of several figures can better identify treatable traits of covid-19 disease, early identify patients who can quickly deteriorate, particularly patients with multiple comorbidities, and better manage complications related to off-label treatments. although no generalizable to other hospitals and different healthcare settings, we think that our experience and our point of view can be helpful for countries and hospitals that are now starting to face the covid-19 outbreak. worldwide, several hospitals in different regions and countries have been affected with corona virus disease-19 (covid-19). covid-19 is known to cause serious respiratory symptoms and involvement of other body systems such as hematopoietic, neurological and the immune system. 
Immunologist warns Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s  https://t.co/e41d3OssWU [SEP] recently, vaccination has been shown to be effective in mouse models of another neurodegenerative condition, namely alzheimer's disease. because vaccines produce antibodies internally at much lower cost, vaccination might be the most promising approach to reducing the global burden of dementia. alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. recently, a vaccine therapy for alzheimer's disease was developed as a curative treatment. although clinical trials of active vaccination for alzheimer's disease were halted due to the development of meningoencephalitis in some patients, the clinical and pathological findings of treated patients suggest that the vaccine therapy is effective. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is concerning for patients with neuroimmunological diseases who are receiving immunotherapy. uncertainty remains about whether immunotherapies increase the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) or increase the risk of severe disease and death upon infection. the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has substantially affected patients with dementia and their caregivers. a novel vaccine addressing the major hallmarks of alzheimer's disease (ad), senile plaque-like deposits of amyloid beta-protein (aβ), neurofibrillary tangle-like structures, and glial proinflammatory cytokines, has been developed. due to side effects in the form of meningoencephalitis in the interrupted phase ii an1792 trial of active antiamyloid β(aβ) immunization against alzheimer's disease (ad), there has been concern that anti-aβ immunization may cause destructive neuroinflammation. 
(MERS) -- a far deadlier cousin of Covid-19 that scientists #fear could cause the next global #pandemic. #s63 #s63 #studio63 #journo #journalism #kenya #africa #nairobi #featurereporting #reporting #digitalcontent #contentcreator #humans #humaninterest #millenials #documentary [SEP] opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against sars-cov-2, the causal agent of covid-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2-4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. •the article shed new light about the surprise effect of covid 19.•the surprise lies in the co-action of two different agents.•these agents are the evolved new properties of sars-cov2 and too much physical connectivity.•the pointed-out co-action was catastrophic revealing the fragility of our institutions and globalized socioeconomic system.•new research avenues are proposed related to the concept of k-vaves. covid-19 has been one of the worst public health calamities faced by humankind in over a century. since the sars/mers epidemic, scientists across the world have been racing to identify the novel-covs as it has been predicted that next epidemic can very well be a result from a new mutation of cov, for which hundred mutations have already been discovered, and the same fear has come true with world facing a raging pandemic due to covid-19, an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (sars-cov-2), is a single stranded rna virus. covid -19 is highly contagious and has resulted in current global pandemic with almost no country of the world unaffected by this virus. coronavirus disease (covid 19), which was started in wuhan, china in december 2019 has become a pandemic, leading to unprecedented risk to the human race. on january 30, 2020, world health organization (who) stated that a new coronavirus disease outbreak [coronavirus disease - 19 (covid-19)] was an international public health emergency. keywords such as "novel coronavirus," "china coronavirus," "covid-19," "2019-ncov," and "sars-cov-2" were the top infodemic and scientific covid-19 terms trending in italy. since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. 
Is It Safe to Take a COVID-19 Vaccine?  Yes. Contrary to some rumors floating around, the COVID-19 vaccines are tested and safe for use. Aside from mild side effects, vaccines do not cause long-term health complications. To know more, talk to us.  #VijayPatelMD #COVID19Vaccine https://t.co/HoRRWvAUN7 [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. the development of covid-19 vaccines is occurring at a rapid pace, with the potential for a vaccine to be available within 6 months. to control the covid-19 pandemic, governments need to ensure a successful large-scale administration of covid-19 vaccines when safe and efficacious vaccines become available. present hopes to conquer the covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. covid-19 vaccines are coming to canada, with the government announcing in august 2020 agreements with four different companies for their covid-19 vaccine if their trials are successful. as covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. an efficacious covid-19 vaccine is currently the world's leading research priority. prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards covid-19 vaccination. approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for covid-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. messages promoting covid-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant. 
   Covid causes myocarditis much more frequently than a vaccine. [SEP] viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis and coxsackie b viruses (cbv) are the most frequently cited etiologic agents associated with myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. clinical importance of myocarditis, predominantly caused by coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3), is recently rising. increases in cardiac troponin indicative of myocardial injury are common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) and are associated with adverse outcomes such as arrhythmias and death. myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from sars-cov-2 are important etiologies, but primary noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis, probably cause more of the myocardial injury. human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19)-related myocarditis cases have been reported. the pathophysiology of covid-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. covid-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. there are now well-documented cardiac complications of covid-19 infection which include myocarditis, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome resulting from coronary artery thrombosis or sars-cov-2-related plaque ruptures. viral myocarditis, mainly caused by enteroviruses specially coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) infection, is a common clinical cardiovascular disease and characterized by cardiac massive inflammation. our previous study showed that cvb3-induced myocardial nlrp3 contributed to the development of viral myocarditis. 
Nina unqualified Twitter doctors [NEWLINE]STOP advising COVID positive people to not go to hospital when their symptoms worsen & breathing gets hard[NEWLINE]Hypoxia (less oxygen in your blood/tissue) can & will cause damage to their brain cells. Hence most COVID survivors experience memory loss [SEP] with the covid-19 pandemic, the fear among patients of contracting it has made them reluctant to seek medical attention on a timely basis even for emergent conditions. information about the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 who were not admitted to hospital is limited. the aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of mortality associated with covid-19 infection among a sample of patients in wuhan whose conditions were reported on social media. we found that lack of admission to hospital (odds ratio [or] 5.82, 95% ci 3.36-10.1; p<.001), older age (or 1.08, 95% ci 1.06-1.1; p<.001), diffuse distribution (or 11.09, 95% ci 0.93-132.9; p=.058), and hypoxemia (odds ratio 2.94, 95% ci 1.32-6.6; p=.009) were associated with increasing odds of death. older age, diffuse distribution, and hypoxemia are factors that can help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 who have poor prognosis. the covid-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing covid-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress. according to the latest literature, most patients with covid-19 have mild symptoms that do not require hospital admissions, and only a small percentage of those hospitalized require intensive care. during the ongoing coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic, reports in social media and the lay press indicate that a subset of patients are presenting with severe hypoxemia in the absence of dyspnea, a problem unofficially referred to as "silent hypoxemia." to decrease the risk of complications in such patients, one proposed solution has been to have those diagnosed with covid-19 but not sick enough to warrant admission monitor their arterial oxygenation by pulse oximetry at home and present for care when they show evidence of hypoxemia. carbon monoxide (co) is regarded as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. 
   Hypercapnia is a condition that can be easily corrected by your own body, or presents over days/hours due to underlying issues with your lungs caused by things like smoking damage, morbid obesity or - guess what - Covid 19.[NEWLINE]You can avoid Hyoercapnia by using a face covering. [SEP] the protective effects of so called therapeutic hypercapnia' remain experimental at present, but promising laboratory studies suggest potential roles for the eventual selective application at the bedside. hypercapnia characterizes a variety of physiological and pathological states and must be compensated effectively by the respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and intra- and extracellular ph buffering systems to maintain homeostasis. the role of vagal control in orchestration and optimization of respiratory response to hypercapnia is discussed. permissive hypercapnia is a commonly used ventilator strategy in attempt to improve refractory hypoxemia. here, we report a case in which the altered mental status caused by hypercapnia is underlined by a life-threatening mechanism. the case indicates the severity of hypercapnia may have been mistakenly overlooked in the past. current protective lung ventilation strategies commonly involve hypercapnia. advances in our understanding of the biology of hypercapnia have prompted consideration of the potential for hypercapnia to play an active role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tissue injury. in fact, hypercapnia may protect against lung and systemic organ injury independently of ventilator strategy. this article reviews the current clinical status of permissive hypercapnia, discusses insights gained to date from basic scientific studies of hypercapnia and acidosis, identifies key unresolved concerns regarding hypercapnia, and considers the potential clinical implications for the management of patients with acute lung injury. 
 Out of the 3,000,000+ doses that were administered, 6 women got blood clots.  There are lots of medicines that cause this very rare side effect, and being vaccinated against COVID should be worth the risk. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated [SEP] we sought to estimate the number needed to vaccinate to prevent hpv-related diseases and death. the number needed to vaccinate was calculated as the number of women who would need to be vaccinated to prevent an hpv-related event during their lifetime. the prothrombotic effect of combined oral contraceptives (cocs) is well-established, with a 3-6-fold increased risk of vte compared to non-users. although the meningococcal conjugate menacwy-crm vaccine is not approved for use in pregnant women, unintentional exposure during pregnancy can occur, especially during early pregnancy among women of child-bearing age. this study provides safety information about inadvertent menacwy-crm vaccination during pregnancy. review of published cases of pregnancies in which coumarin derivatives or heparin were administered demonstrates that use of either class of anticoagulant carries substantial risks. because of the substantial risks of both clases of anticoagulants, and the inherent risks of pregnancy complicated by the indications for anticoagulation, prevention of pregnancy is usually indicated. it is imperative to vaccinate pregnant women against this virus. unvaccinated women who come in contact with the virus should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. within 16 months, we saw six cases in which young women taking anticoagulants to prevent clotting of prosthetic heart valves suffered corpus luteum hemorrhages. 
With the uncertainties associated with #COVID, many people have turned to food as a coping mechanism. Eating due to boredom or stress may provide temporary satisfaction. However, over time, this can cause weight gain and emotional distress. Read more 👉 https://t.co/cxvKKTkIiy [SEP] analysis of 6 semi-structured qualitative interviews with individuals who are either at risk of being overweight (body mass index [bmi] = 23-24.99), or above a healthy weight (bmi ⩾ 25), revealed 3 overarching themes: (1) why am i all about food? in today's society, obesity rates are rising as food intake is no longer only a response to physiological hunger signals that ensure survival. eating can represent a reward, a response to boredom, or stress reduction and emotion regulation. while most people decrease food intake in response to stress or negative emotions, some do the opposite. an attention bias for food could be such a cognitive factor that contributes to overeating. overall, the current state of research suggests that biased attention could be one important cognitive mechanism by which the food environment tempts us into overeating. people often crave for high-caloric sweet foods when facing stress and this 'emotional eating' is a most important cause for weight gain and obesity. eating under stress contrasts with the normally expected response of a loss of appetite, yet in spite of intensive research from neurobiological and cognitive disciplines we still do not know why stress or negative affect triggers overeating in so many of us. this paper summarizes the most relevant current knowledge from the (human) literature regarding cognitive and biological vulnerabilities for stress-induced emotional eating. two barriers to long-term weight loss are reward-driven eating, which is characterized by a lack of control over eating, a preoccupation with food, and a lack of satiety; and psychological stress. 
  The vaccine has a higher survival rate yet conspiracy nutjobs freak out about that. See how it's disingenuous to focus only on survival rate? You're ignoring those critically ill - which included Boris in ICU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignore death statistics, look up the damage covid causes your body. https://t.co/1yTsjreJfm [SEP] one-sided health 'education' campaigns on whooping cough vaccine have questionable ethics, and suppression of dissenting views is counterproductive. worries about bioterrorism have thus sparked debate about whether or not the smallpox vaccine, which can be dangerous, should be offered to the general public. the impact that vaccines have had on world health has been great. vaccines have prevented and nearly eliminated several deadly diseases, yet they face skepticism from the public. misestimations may distort the perceived risks of vaccinating. the current study examined how vaccine skepticism is related to accuracy in event frequency processing. in experiment 2 (n = 109), we again found that vaccine skepticism was negatively associated with vital statistic estimation accuracy but not for emotionally neutral or positive events. these results suggest that vaccine skepticism may arise from basic individual differences in processing events associated with mortality or negative affect. the reason for the latter is the perception by some people that vaccines are unsafe. improving our knowledge base of severe immunologically mediated vaccine reactions and their management drives better vaccine safety and efficacy outcomes. 
  Mental health is more complicated. It’s not either or. Don’t forget Covid itself will cause mental health issues in many suffering  irreversible organ damage, chronic pain and other long term neurological symptoms, plus grief from lost loved ones, trauma to nhs staff etc. [SEP] caring for someone with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can result in considerable consequences for the caregiver. carers often experience a range of negative emotions, impacts upon their physical and mental health, as well as financial strain. previous research has identified that, while there are positive as well as negative elements to the caring role, carers are at high risk of mental health problems and that the comprehensive burden of caring has social, economic and health based elements. without adequate psychosocial support, distressed caregivers are at risk for psychiatric and medical morbidity, which can adversely affect patient outcomes. the covid pandemic has been devastating for not only its direct impact on lives, physical health, socio-economic status of individuals, but also for its impact on mental health. some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care. however, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected. an integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to covid but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic. a series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of covid19. urgent action is needed to strengthen mental health system in all settings. 
Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/CeJM6NoGhQ [SEP] covid-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001), severe disease (nihss >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p = 0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mrs 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p = 0.001). covid-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome. neurological complications have emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) such as encephalitis and seizures have been reported increasingly, but our understanding of covid-19-related brain injury is still limited. some of the reported neurological manifestations of covid-19 are encephalopathy, headache, ischemic, hemorrhagic stroke, miller fisher syndrome, cranial neuropathies, and guillain-barre syndrome. the magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic will result in substantial neurological disease, whether through direct infection (rare), para-infectious complications (less rare), or critical illness more generally (common). additional to the direct neurological complications of covid-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial covid-19 infection. covid-19 patients can develop large-scale ischemic strokes in previously healthy patients without risk factors, especially in patients who develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (sars-cov-2). covid-19 has a wide-ranging and multimodal neurological impact. first, several neurological symptoms and complications are commonly observed in patients with covid-19. 
  And to be clear I'm NOT trying to say that *only* the vaccine could cause an ADE issue in the future. Antibodies from surviving Covid-19 could potentially trigger the same problem. But what is impossible to know at this point is if the vaccine boosted antibody response could [SEP] the actual effectiveness of the still-to-come vaccination against the coronavirus sars-cov-2 might be challenged by vaccine hesitancy, a rather common and known phenomenon whose psychological predictors are, nevertheless, still largely debated. whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. such a vaccine should efficiently induce high-affinity neutralizing antibodies which neutralize sars-cov-2, the cause of covid-19. however, there is a concern regarding both vaccine-induced eosinophilic lung disease and eosinophil-associated th2 immunopotentiation following infection after vaccination. here, we review the anticipated characteristics of a covid-19 vaccine to avoid vaccine-associated eosinophil immunopathology. might covid-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) breakthrough infections? this is unlikely because coronavirus diseases in humans lack the clinical, epidemiological, biological, or pathological attributes of ade disease exemplified by dengue viruses (denv). safe and effective covid-19 vaccines must avoid vah. much research effort is focused on developing an effective vaccine for combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). despite overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy and refusal leading to increases in the incidence of communicable diseases. 
Don't touch your face😱! We've all heard it can promote the spread of #covid . It's always a good idea, though. Touching your face introduces bacteria & irritants to your face that can exacerbate or cause acne & contact dermatitis. #udc #skinfacts #skincare #face #donttouch https://t.co/0UQYLIYky2 [SEP] acne vulgaris is almost a widespread disease occurring in all races. propionibacterium acnes initiate acne and inflammatory mediators aggravate it. shared cosmetics in beauty salons are almost contaminated by bacteria and fungus.therefore, it is suggested to avoid sharing cosmetics by women and prevent use of public cosmetics in toilet saloons. intensive degreasing of the skin reduces propionibacterium acnes but also may cause skin irritation. washing the face with a mild cleanser is generally recommended for acne care. occasionally, the general public has the misconception that acne is exacerbated by cleansers and furthermore it has concerns about inducing skin irritation and xerosis by intensive washing. washing the face twice a day with facial cleanser based on aec/soap is an effective care for moderate or less grade facial acne. inadequate hygiene, aggressive cleansing, and chafing skin folds, as well as urine, feces, and sweat may trigger irritative contact dermatitis in the anogenital area. allergy to preservatives is one of the main reasons for contact eczema caused by cosmetics. as development and elicitation of contact allergy is dose dependent, over preservation of cosmetics potentially leads to increased incidences of contact allergy. 
The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccines works by effectively revving up the immune system to fight off the virus that causes the disease. But what if that same approach could be used to turn the immune system down to treat autoimmune disorders? https://t.co/YK3Rxfzed5 [NEWLINE]#mRNA [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. despite accumulating preclinical data demonstrating a crucial role of cytotoxic t cell immunity during viral infections, ongoing efforts on developing covid-19 vaccines are mostly focused on antibodies. following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), several immunotherapies were applied to modulate the immune responses of the affected patients. in this review, we aimed to describe the role of the immune system in response to covid-19. based on the available evidence, it seems that treatment with immunotherapy along with other standard cares could be an effective and safe approach to modulate the immune system and improvement of clinical outcomes. to control and prevent the current covid-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. an inexpensive readily manufactured covid-19 vaccine that protects against severe disease is needed to combat the pandemic. this review presents a brief overview of the immune system regarding its protection of the human body from covid-19; illustrates the process of the immune system, how it works, and its mechanism to fight virus; and presents information on the most recent covid-19 treatments and experimental data. the ongoing pandemic of covid-19 infection demands efforts to reduce spread. 
 I have APS, the syndrome which develops with both vaccine and covid to cause clots, had AZ with no ill effects but I'm anticoagulated. Those who aren't and then have other risk factors like OCP could be the ones developing these complications. It's just a blood test, easily done. [SEP] vaccines have had a dramatic effect on the prevalence of communicable diseases, but, in selected individuals, the injection presents a risk of anaphylaxis. fortunately, most people have no allergic reactions to vaccines. however, there have been reports of autoimmune side effects post vaccination. we therefore aim to investigate the possible relationship of severe autoimmune adverse events (arthritis, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, guillain-barre syndrome, optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis) post zoster vaccination with a matched case-control study of reported events in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). our study showed no significantly increased risks of severe autoimmune adverse events, except arthritis and alopecia, after vaccination. compared to the unexposed, patients with zoster vaccination had 2.2 and 2.7 times the odds of developing arthritis and alopecia, respectively (p<0.001 and p=0.015, respectively). zoster vaccine is, therefore, relatively safe and unlikely to exacerbate or induce autoimmune diseases. given its benefits and safety but low coverage, dermatologists and primary care physicians should encourage zoster vaccine use in elderly patients, including selected patients with autoimmune diseases. although most adverse effects attributed to vaccines are mild, rare reactions such as autoimmunity do occur. the children were investigated for autoantibodies including anti-nuclear antibodies (anas), anti-smooth muscle antibodies, anti-ndna, anti-microsomal antibodies, anti-cardiolipin (acl) immunoglobulin (ig) m/igg, anti-ds dna, ana profile, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody profile. 
   Only Covid19  Like how fi8nding means awareness and studies No funding means go and die in a ditch So 1/2 covid deaths were fungal or bacterial.  Maybe start there Do we have any scientist in Canada.Fungal respiratory infections kill millions, cause cancer, blindness NoBody cares https://t.co/eFqlGSkExt [SEP] cryptococcus gattii is responsible for a large outbreak of potentially fatal disease that started in the late 1990s on vancouver island, canada. there are currently no nationwide epidemiological data on fungal infections in canada. among the population of canada (35.5 million in 2014), it was estimated that approximately 1.8% are affected by a serious fungal infection. in 1999, the population of vancouver island, canada, began to experience an outbreak of a fatal fungal disease caused by a highly virulent lineage of cryptococcus gattii. we summarize the challenges and opportunities for canadian fungal research that were discussed at canfunnet's inaugural meeting in 2019, and identify 4 priorities for our community: (i) increasing collaboration among scientists, (ii) studying diversity in the context of ecological disturbance, (iii) preserving culture collections in the absence of sustained funding, and (iv) leveraging diverse expertise to attract trainees. we have gathered additional information to support our recommendations, including a survey identifying underrepresentation of fungal-related courses at canadian universities, a list of canadian fungaria and culture collections, and a case study of a human fungal pathogen outbreak. covid-19 has infected millions of people, with an estimated total dead in the hundreds of thousands. this article describes challenges of the covid-19 pandemic from the perspective of a canadian nuclear medicine resident, including new risks with nuclear imaging, navigating new and sometimes challenging guidelines, as well as working and living within the confines of social distancing. the covid-19 pandemic presents the worst public health crisis in recent history. the response to the covid-19 pandemic has been challenged by many factors, including scientific uncertainties, scarcity of relevant research, proliferation of misinformation and fake news, poor access to actionable evidence, time constraints, and weak collaborations among relevant stakeholders. 
    Not to mention the lasting damage covid has on a person, we’re still finding out that covid can cause life changing issues, fibrosis, COPD, Diabetes, CKD, brain tissue death, to name a few these are in relatively Healthy people [SEP] the disease course in chronic illness may be subtle and accompanied by irreversible changes that have to be managed. once the immediacy of the illness has been dealt with, the patient may face a future full of uncertainties related to illness recurrence, further disease progression, and perhaps even death. numerous studies have discovered negative health consequences associated with spousal caregiving at the end of life; however, little is known about how care-recipient cognitive status impacts caregiver health outcomes, specifically in the area of frailty, and whether health consequences remain over time. given our findings, we discuss public health implications regarding the health and well-being of caregivers of persons with dementia. caring for someone who is chronically ill permeates every aspect of life. multiple chronic conditions (mccs) are common and have harmful consequences in later life. living with a chronic illness affects every aspect of a person's life, including his or her sense of self, family relationships and work. the stress associated with informal caregiving has been shown to be associated with poor health, including coronary heart disease (chd). caregiving in midlife is not in itself associated with greater risk of chd, but it is associated with increased risk for chd among caregivers who report being in poor health. the demands of caregiving place caregivers at risk for becoming ill themselves. 
•In Africa, malaria has caused approximately four times as many deaths as COVID-19 over the past year.[NEWLINE]•Scientists are trialling a malaria vaccine which prevents the disease 77% of the time among those receiving it - a landmark which has never been reached before. [SEP] despite nearly 80 years of vaccine research and control efforts, malaria remains one of the most prevalent of all infectious diseases. a malaria vaccine is needed because of the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity due to this disease. to assess the effect of blood-stage malaria vaccines in preventing infection, disease, and death. background: malaria is one of the most widespread and deadly diseases worldwide and large majority of malaria cases and deaths occurs in africa. plasmodium falciparum malaria is a disease causing high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, mainly in sub-saharan africa. malaria is one of the world's most important diseases, and an effective, licensed vaccine would be a major public health tool. annually, malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths, is responsible for the loss of >1% of gross domestic product (gdp) in africa and is a serious concern for travelers. the development of malaria vaccines is therefore a priority for africa. the continuing morbidity and mortality associated with infection with malaria parasites highlights the urgent need for a vaccine. malaria remains one of the world's greatest killers and a vaccine is urgently required. 
  No but keep in mind they also believe the world is flat and that 5G causes covid and vaccines cause infertility & autism 😒 [SEP] balb/c mice were vaccinated with 5gp dna or 5gp protein emulsified in isa 720 or freund's adjuvant. the 5gp dna-vaccinated mice had less blepharitis and latency than any other group and had the highest levels of il-12 and ifn-gamma. vaccinology is not a rational science. next, vaccines remain undervalued by people, by government, and by society. in the u.s., school entry requirements have kept childhood immunization rates high by five years of age. in the absence of disease and lack of public knowledge of these diseases, complacency sets in, immunization rates fall, with the expected result on occurrence of disease. a maximum-likelihood tree shows that all 5 chinese vdpvs were independent. one-fifth of global mortality, especially in children under the age of five is due to infectious diseases. by its policy of the use of opv in low and middle-income countries, while rich countries use the safe inactivated polio vaccine (ipv), the global polio eradication programme has been responsible for social injustice. in 2017 and 2018, there were outbreaks of polio in syria and papua new guinea due to circulating vdpvs, after many years of these countries remaining free of polio due to wild polioviruses. 
                     DO NOT RECEIVE SATAN'S VACCINES[NEWLINE]VACCINES FORBIDDEN by THE CREATOR[NEWLINE]VACCINES do NOT PREVENT Covid19 infection or transmission of the virus.[NEWLINE]VACCINES cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects. [NEWLINE]VACCINES contain harmful ingredients. [NEWLINE]VACCINES MADE FOR PROFIT not MEDICAL REASONS https://t.co/MlETm8pZCE [SEP] the novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is the cause of covid-19, which has had a devastating international impact. test results of a complete viral pathogen panel and covid-19 testing were abstracted. covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. healthcare workers (hcws) reporting no history of varicella frequently receive varicella vaccination (voka) if they test varicella-zoster virus (vzv) immunoglobulin g (igg) negative. a total of 110 hcws received two doses of voka vaccine spaced 6 weeks apart and sera collected pre-vaccination (n = 100), at 6 weeks post-completion of vaccination (n = 86) and at 12-18 months follow-up (n = 73) were analysed. mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. this article draws on a broadcast popular among the anti-vaccine community to map out six themes used by the broadcast to mislead viewers about covid-19. the article points out that similar themes are used to mislead followers with anti-vaccine information. it highlights the concern that these themes will not only mislead people who are already anti-vaccine about the pandemic, but may draw in people who are not anti-vaccine but are seeking information about covid-19, and suggests some options for dealing with the misinformation. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. 
   Millions of people die every year from HIV virus, why is it that virus cannot be controlled and #COVID19 can, the same viruses that cause cancer, what makes Covid19 more important than the others, climate change, #climate measures, #reset economy, this is the #reason for Covid19! https://t.co/a14m4XUdzh [SEP] the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has rapidly spread all over the world in the past several months. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has rapidly spread all over the world in the past several months. covid-19, as an infectious disease, has shocked the world and still threatens the lives of billions of people. the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic in 2020 has brought about complex challenges in healthcare delivery. coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) has globally affected the human mortality rate and economic history of the modern world. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has gripped the world and is evolving day by day with deaths every hour. soaring cases of coronavirus disease (covid-19) are pummeling the global health system. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has infected millions of people worldwide and emerged to be the biggest global health threat claiming hundreds of thousands of lives at exponential rates. covid-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe. covid-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. 
 The worldwide Covid vaccine program is actually a gain-of-function exercise.  Geert Vanden Bossche and Bret Weinstein April 23 2021 https://t.co/Z3VDVJMChC  Ep 79.1: Viruses are messages; Can be hacked to control life and cause disease. https://t.co/TNKUUvJURZ [SEP] this is particularly important in today's era, in light of the global transparency regarding vaccination development, and the potential for future pandemics such as covid-19. undoubtedly, vaccination is one of the health interventions showing major impact on humankind. vaccination is mankind's greatest public health success story. genetic modification of viruses not only allows for their attenuation but also for incorporation of sequences from other viruses, turning one pathogen into a vaccine carrier for another. vaccination is an effective and proven method of preventing infectious diseases. the main objective of the games was disease control with a collective perspective. vaccination is one of humanity's main tools to fight epidemics. there are many reasons for the modern interest in viral vaccines, but there is no doubt that the key role played by viral vaccines in public health is the major factor since other prophylactic or therapeutic anti-viral products simply do not exist. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. vaccines have changed modern medicine, and are a mainstay in reducing morbidity and mortality from infections. 
   It is very rare in the context of the vaccine and myocarditis in general. Vaccines cause side effects, they wouldn’t work otherwise. It’s simply just a reaction to your body making antibodies and C-Reactive Protein. And compared to actually getting covid, it’s not that bad. [SEP] the incidence of anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to vaccines is very low, less than one case per million vaccine doses. although concerns about vaccine safety have increased, true adverse reactions associated with hepatitis b vaccines are few, apart from minor symptoms at the site of injection and occasionally systemic reactions. adverse reactions to vaccines are relatively rare, instead, and those recognizing a hypersensitivity mechanism are even rarer. severe immunologically mediated reactions are rare and less common with the vaccine than the true infection. in this paper, we perform a systematic literature search and narrative review of immune-mediated vaccine adverse events and their known and proposed mechanisms, and outline directions for future research. anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare but do occur, and have been reported for nearly every vaccine. adverse effects following immunization to vaccines (aefi) are considered extremely rare events, the occurrence of which could gain a major role in optimizing allergy diagnosis by cellular tests. experience with the vaccine can be summarized as follows: there were minimal problems with neuralgia and neuropathy as a result of the vaccine; vaccinated children were not a significant source of infection to the pregnant woman; the duration of immunity is similar to that obtained with natural rubella virus, but with lower antibody levels; and reinfection is more common with vaccination, but apparently no viremia develops. however, reports of postvaccination serious adverse events such as autoimmunity, although rare, have caused great concerns among the general public. although there are known adverse reactions to the vaccine, the majority are relatively minor and have no long term consequences, and those that do have long term consequences are extremely rare. 
Interesting study. Please take your vaccine when offered it. The sooner you do, the faster we are out of these restrictions 🙏 x  Covid eight times more likely to cause rare brain clot than AstraZeneca vaccine, study finds https://t.co/mm5W9s4HJH [SEP] in february 2008, we alerted the advisory committee on immunization practices to preliminary evidence of a twofold increased risk of febrile seizures after the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (mmrv) vaccine when compared with separate measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) and varicella vaccines. now with data on twice as many vaccine recipients, our goal was to reexamine seizure risk after mmrv vaccine. we compared seizure risk after mmrv vaccine to that after mmr + varicella vaccines by using poisson regression as well as with supplementary regressions that incorporated chart-review results and self-controlled analyses. seizure risk during days 7 to 10 was higher after mmrv than after mmr + varicella vaccination (relative risk: 1.98 [95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.73]). the excess risk for febrile seizures 7 to 10 days after mmrv compared with separate mmr + varicella vaccination was 4.3 per 10,000 doses (95% confidence interval: 2.6-5.6). vaccination with mmrv results in 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2300 doses given instead of separate mmr + varicella vaccines. once a new vaccine has been licensed and is in widespread use, it is important to be able to detect and investigate adverse events which may be associated with the vaccine. to assess the risk of serious adverse events following dtap-ipv vaccination. prelicensure adverse events were minimal; however, since licensure and increased vaccine use, rare previously undetected risks have arisen. a multicenter clinical trial was conducted among 757 healthy adolescents and adults, 13-54 years, to compare two regimens of oka/merck varicella vaccine with respect to safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. 
   Dying isn't the only effect. COVID is a vascular disease and has been shown to cause permanent brain damage. So it looks like we'll be supporting a large class of brain damaged conservatives. [SEP] vascular cognitive impairment (vci) is a major contributor to age-related dementing illnesses which imposes a tremendous burden on families and society. brain injury from ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (cvd) produces decline in cognitive functions and vascular dementia (vad). cvd may also worsen degenerative dementias such as alzheimer's disease. ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (cvd) produces injury of brain regions important for executive function, behavior, and memory leading to decline in cognitive functions and vascular dementia (vad). cvd may worsen degenerative dementias such as alzheimer disease (ad). cerebral small vessel disease (csvd) is a common age-related vascular disease of the brain associated with slowly accumulating tissue damage and represents a leading cause of functional loss, disability and cognitive decline in the elderly. the promotion of cognitive reserve might be a valuable possibility to moderate the negative impact of accumulating brain changes associated with csvd on cognitive function and thus limit the functional consequences of csvd. chronic brain injury following cerebral ischemia is a severe debilitating neurological condition, where clinical intervention is well known to decrease morbidity and mortality. cch is thought to link with neurodegenerative disorders and their subsequent cognitive deteriorate on. vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (vcid) is a major public health concern because of the increased incidence of vascular disease in the aging population and the impact of vascular disease on alzheimer's disease. 
    covid vaccine doesn't cause fertility issues, or any of the things you mentioned  https://t.co/unEXqNzugT [SEP] two pre-licensure studies reported similar anti-hpv but lower anti-hbs titers when co-administering hpv and hbv vaccines. we report that vaccine dilution (1:1 or 1:10) and previous vaccinia virus vaccination status had no significant effect on cell-mediated immune responses (i.e., the immediate vaccinia virus-specific gamma interferon-producing t-cell response measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay) 1 month after smallpox vaccination (lancy-vaxina; berna biotech, switzerland). there were no serious vaccine-related adverse events, nor were there intercurrent hiv infections. many studies have shown that these routine vaccines may have more general effects on the immune system than merely protecting against the targeted disease, i.e. gacvs indicated that "conclusive evidence for or against non-specific effects of vaccines on mortality, including a potential deleterious effect of dtp vaccination on children's survival as has been reported in some studies, was unlikely to be obtained from observational studies" (5). several studies investigating potential adverse effects of the pandemic a(h1n1) vaccine have supported that influenza a(h1n1) vaccination does not increase the risk for major pregnancy and birth adverse outcomes, but little is known about possible adverse effects in offspring of a(h1n1)-vaccinated mothers beyond the perinatal period and into early childhood. to evaluate whether pandemic influenza a(h1n1) vaccination in pregnancy increases the risk for early childhood morbidity in offspring. children exposed in the first trimester were not more likely to be hospitalized in early childhood than unexposed children (hospitalization rates per 1000 person-years, 300.6 for exposed vs 257.5 for unexposed; rate ratio, 1.17; 95% ci, 0.94-1.45). these results support the safety profile of the influenza a(h1n1) vaccine used in pregnancy. the vaccine did not cause any significant reactions. 
    I never said Covid-19 wasn’t a real coronavirus.  And deaths linked to Covid-19 are primarily caused directly from pneumonia, or flu-like symptoms.  The classifications for influenza and pneumonia reporting changed when Covid-19 appeared.  Facts. [SEP] during the early stages of the pandemic, some coronavirus disease (covid-19) patients were misdiagnosed as having influenza, which aroused the concern that some deaths attributed to influenza were actually covid-19-related. similar to the influenza a pandemic in 1918/1919, the new coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has spread globally. the causes of death in covid-19 are frequently compared to a seasonal influenza outbreak. covid-19 shared many symptoms with seasonal flu, and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) since the responses to covid-19 are dramatically different, this multicenter study aimed to develop and validate a multivariate model to accurately discriminate covid-19 from influenza and cap. this article explains how the mortality rate of an illness such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is calculated as well as how the definition of what is a "case" has changed from the earliest days of the pandemic to now. it is possible that some people are dying from covid-19 without being diagnosed, and/or that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. recently, some global cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) pneumonia have been caused by second- or third-generation transmission of the viral infection, resulting in no traceable epidemiological history. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic. novel corona virus caused pneumonia first reported in december, 2019 in wuhan, china was later named covid-19. coronavirus disease (covid-19) was officially declared a pandemic in march 2020. 
COVID vaccine is likely to cause infertility issues through an autoimmune disorder that affects placenta development. What a wonderful coincidence that vaccines tend to cause autoimmune disorders, even a new experimental one. Btw, autism is being found to be an autoimmune issue. https://t.co/7hzF1xKybH [SEP] a recent epidemiological study found that gestational viral exposure during the first trimester increases risk of autism in offspring by twofold. three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. because of a temporal correlation between the first notable signs and symptoms of autism and the routine childhood vaccination schedule, many parents have become increasingly concerned regarding the possible etiologic role vaccines may play in the development of autism. other autoimmune illnesses have been associated with vaccinations. even though the data regarding the relation between vaccination and autoimmune disease is conflicting, it seems that some autoimmune phenomena are clearly related to immunization (e.g. there is a compelling argument that the occurrence of regressive autism is attributable to genetic and chromosomal abnormalities, arising from the overuse of vaccines, which subsequently affects the stability and function of the autonomic nervous system and physiological systems. however, the development of a vaccine against a virus suspected to induce an autoimmune disease is challenging, since the vaccine itself might trigger autoimmunity. vaccines have been suspected of playing a role in inducing autoimmune disease (aid) for a long time. in spite of this, many isolated cases or series of cases of arthritis, vasculitis, and central or peripheral nervous system symptoms following vaccination have been reported. thus, cases of aid triggered by vaccines are highly rare and raise questions about the interaction between vaccines and/or their adjuvants and the genetic context of autoimmune disease. 
  All of these people are missing the long term unknown risks of covid infection. Epstein Barr Virus is a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, hep B & C cause liver cancer. 15% of cancers are viral! And people don’t want to risk vaccines???? [SEP] high-risk human papillomavirus cervical infection is currently a well-established cause of cervical cancer. epidemiological and laboratory-based studies have identified infection with one of 15 high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) types as a necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer. high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hpv) are the causative agents of cervical and anogenital cancers and are associated with 5% of all human cancers. chronic infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (hpv) types is a necessary, but insufficient, cause in the development of more cancers than any other virus. high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) are present in virtually all cervical carcinomas. however, the majority of women infected with high-risk hpvs do not develop cervical cancer. vaccines to prevent hpv infection and cancer development have proven effective, but are not useful in individuals with prior hpv exposure. treatment vaccines to eradicate or control hpv-associated lesions are therefore desirable for these patients. prophylactic hpv vaccination appears safe, immunogenic and, by extrapolation, likely to reduce hpv-associated cancer development among persons with hiv infection. using an empirically calibrated mathematical model that simulates the natural history of cervical cancer, we estimated the cumulative number of causal hpv infections by age, stratified by hpv genotype (hpv16 vs. other hpv genotypes), and the direct age-specific reduction in cancer incidence for alternative vaccination initiation scenarios (i.e., age 9-45 years). 
 Sorry[NEWLINE]Dexamethasone can cause blood clots, will help #COVID19 [NEWLINE]Try Tadalfil instead, it helps lungs, reduces inflammation and clotting[NEWLINE]Forget purpose of medicine, we need results [SEP] dexamethasone was shown to decrease the mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) recently. evidence from a randomized control study found dexamethasone is effective in decreasing mortality in severe covid-19 cases. in june 2020, a large randomised controlled clinical trial in the uk found that dexamethasone was effective in reducing the number of deaths in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the first drug that has shown promise in reducing covid-19 mortality in severely-ill patients is dexamethasone, a cheap, well-known anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, approved for the treatment of inflammatory conditions including respiratory diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis. additionally, using higher doses of dexamethasone for prolonged periods of time can lead to severe side effects and some patients may develop corticosteroid resistance leading to treatment failure. our studies demonstrated that labas and dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) exert synergistic effects that will augment both anti-inflammatory and fibronectin-mediated anticoagulant effects. dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients. to determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with covid-19-associated ards. among patients with covid-19 and moderate or severe ards, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days. effective therapies for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are needed, and clinical trial data have demonstrated that low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with covid-19 who required respiratory support. 
  The viruses that cause flu are not the same species as COVID-19, please do not mix them up. Also, HPV does not cause flu, but its long term infection does lead to cancer. What NPR is saying is that long term COVID-19 infection may also lead to serious damage. [SEP] covid-19 pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on the society, economy and heath-care system all over the globe with virus showing no signs of losing potency. the virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. the coronavirus disease of 2019 (covid-19) emerged as a global pandemic. historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of covid-19 disease are not well known. recently, a novel virus has spread worldwide causing the disease called covid-19. in addition to putting people's lives at risk and causing mortality, various problems have occurred due to the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic. currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) from wuhan caused a worldwide panic. coronoviraus disease 2019 (covid-19) has infected over two million people worldwide and the number keeps growing every day. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) will continue to have a significant impact on the way we live for at least the next few years until the scale-up of production and administration of an effective vaccine. the covid-19 pandemic has evolved into arguably the largest global public health crisis in recent history-especially in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or an effective anti-viral treatment. 
If someone tells you the vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage. [SEP] vaccination with mmr in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to covid-19. a total of 5076 (8.8%) pregnant women received trivalent influenza vaccine and 377 stillbirths occurred. there were 5.0 and 3.0 stillbirths per 100 000 pregnancy-days among unvaccinated and vaccinated women, respectively. these results support the safety of seasonal influenza immunization during pregnancy and suggest a protective effect. in the absence of circulating smallpox, pregnant women should not be exposed to live vaccinia virus contained in the smallpox vaccine. in addition, persons who have close contact (e.g., household contact or sexual contact) with pregnant women are advised to forego vaccination. to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its associated impacts on health and society, covid-19 vaccines are essential. the importance of vaccines cannot be overstated during the outbreak of a pandemic, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. might covid-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) breakthrough infections? safe and effective covid-19 vaccines must avoid vah. 
 3) Plus the death rate isn't the full story.  COVID-18 causes vascular damage.  This can result in secondary strokes, loss or reduction of various senses, cardiac problems, and one or more of those conditions which "immuno-compromise" one. [SEP] covid-19 is a pandemic disease which predominantly affects the respiratory system, however it also causes multi-organ dysfunction in a subset of patients. patients with covid-19 have a fairly high risk of neurologic complications, including encephalopathy, stroke, central nervous system infection, seizures, and neuromuscular diseases. direct endothelial injury by viruses and dysregulation of clotting mechanisms due to cytokine storm are the major precipitating factors of mortality in covid-19; both are attributed to a fundamental dysregulation of the immune system. covid-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. we evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (pe), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all covid-19 patients admitted to the icu of 2 dutch university hospitals and 1 dutch teaching hospital. covid-19 interacts at multiple levels with the cardiovascular system. the prognosis of covid-19 infection is known to be worse for patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. furthermore, the virus is responsible for many cardiovascular complications. recognition that mild covid-19 can be complicated by subsequent cardiac injury and/or coagulopathy is important. in some individuals, coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) infection leads to a variety of serious inflammatory symptoms, including blood clotting and acute respiratory distress. 
  The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA. Classen says mRNA vaccines may cause Alzheimer's, ALS, and Prion disease. He provides no evidence for these claims. He doesn't provide proof because there is none. [SEP] messenger rna (mrna) vaccines represent a relatively new vaccine class showing great promise for the future. this optimism is built on recently published studies demonstrating the efficacy of mrna vaccines in combatting several types of cancer and infectious pathogens where conventional vaccine platforms may fail to induce protective immune responses. these results would not have been possible without critical recent innovations in the field, such as the development of safe and efficient materials for in vivo mrna delivery and advanced protocols for the production of high quality mrna. this review summarizes the most important developments in mrna vaccines from the past few years and discusses the challenges and future directions for the field. recent outbreaks of sars-coronavirus and mers-coronavirus (cov) have heightened awareness about the lack of vaccines or antiviral compounds approved for prevention or treatment of human or potential zoonotic covs. using a rat based model of mumps neurovirulence, we demonstrate that this latter virus is significantly attenuated compared to a virus isolated from a patient with post-vaccination meningitis. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the first sars-cov-2 vaccine(s) will likely be licensed based on neutralizing antibodies in phase 2 trials, but there are significant concerns about using antibody response in coronavirus infections as a sole metric of protective immunity. indeed, it is unclear whether antibody production is protective or pathogenic in coronavirus infections. although most vaccine candidates are focusing on spike protein as antigen, natural infection by sars-cov-2 induces broad epitope coverage, cross-reactive with other betacoronviruses. 
Each vaccine has its own side effects may cause even danger to life  Vaccines dont gaurentee prevention from supposed "covid hoax"...   Stop recomanding lockdowns and do vaccin orgy from here onwards .. https://t.co/uurJEyxt67 [SEP] vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. to be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. vaccines always will involve some risk, and risk always involves some public concern. the fear of malevolent use of variola virus by terrorists has led to the implementation of a health care worker vaccination program and to the consideration of vaccination for the general public. however, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. however, these events can cause public fearfulness and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccination. in this paper, we perform a systematic literature search and narrative review of immune-mediated vaccine adverse events and their known and proposed mechanisms, and outline directions for future research. despite overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy and refusal leading to increases in the incidence of communicable diseases. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. 
   masks cause plague... fauci knows... masks promote bacteria... and not the good kind... sinus/lung/teeth and gum/tongue/etc... bacteriological infections... covid is crimes against humanity (:~:)https://t.co/VvPRwcVGPx [SEP] protective respiratory face masks protect the nose and mouth of the wearer from vapor drops carrying viruses or other infectious pathogens. however, incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the risk of pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. the use of biocidal masks may significantly reduce the risk of hand or environmental contamination, and thereby subsequent infection, due to improper handling and disposal of the masks. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has even resulted in a global shortage of face masks and the raw materials that go into them, driving individuals to self-produce masks from household items. this review will cover mask-wearing from the public health perspective, the technical details of commercial and home-made masks, and recent advances in mask engineering, disinfection, and materials and discuss the sustainability of mask-wearing and mask production into the future. since the start of the covid-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. the method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. in covid-19 pandemics days, wearing facial mask in public places has become obligatory to prevent the virus spread. wearing a face mask has become a cause célèbre, with implications of safety for oneself and others, trust in science, and being in defiance of or in lockstep with healthcare authority figures. 
Quick lesson about autoimmune diseases and COVID-19. Auto-Immune disease causes the white blood cells that normally protect your body from invaders to turn around and attack your cells, tissues and organs. Chronic… https://t.co/551UkCqIH3 [SEP] cytokine pathways and their signaling disorders can be the cause of onset and pathogenesis of many diseases such as autoimmune diseases and covid-19 infection. autoimmune patients may be at higher risk of developing infection due to the impaired immune responses, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and damage to various organs. the content used in this paper has been taken from english language articles (2005-2020) retrieved from the pubmed database and google scholar search engine using "covid-19," "autoimmune disease," "therapeutic," "pathogenesis," and "pathway" keywords. the emergence of covid-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. due to the common pathogenesis of covid-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus. key points: • inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 • ace2 dysfunctions are related to the with covid-19 and autoimmune diseases • the use autoimmune diseases drugs can be useful in treating covid-19. immune dysregulation characterized by t cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe covid-19. coronavirus infectious diseases (covid-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has taken a strong grip on the entire global community. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) frequently entails complications that bear similarities to autoimmune diseases. initial reports on the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena in the convalescence phase of sars-cov-2 infection suggests that the immunological consequences of the infection need to be strictly understood. 
 Actually wearing masks causes bacterial pneumonia which people can die from NOT covid19. Most people do not know how to don/doff PPE properly. Follow the science Big Guy! [SEP] pneumonia is an infectious disease caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi that results in millions of deaths globally. however, since the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic, utilization of traditional face mask nippv has been curtailed in part due to risk of aerosolization of respiratory particles and subsequent health care worker exposure. in covid-19 patients, the helmet interface may reduce the risk of virus exposure to health care workers from aerosolization. since the start of the covid-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. the method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. the covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (ppe) for healthcare workers, including filtering facepiece respirators (ffrs) such as n95 masks. despite more than sixty years of scientific medical research, severe pneumonia, either community-acquired or nosocomial, remains a leading cause of death regardless of the patients' immunity state. shortages in the availability of personal protective face masks during the covid-19 pandemic required many to fabricate masks and filter inserts from available materials. with the rapid outbreak of covid-19, most people are facing antivirus mask shortages. 
This Serology (blood) test, can verify the different types of antibodies developed after being exposed  to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is also known as Antibody Test.  [NEWLINE]#coronavirus #covid #corona #staysafe #socialdistancing#pandemic #virus https://t.co/efc4wI6LUR [SEP] the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) serological tests detect antibodies in the host, contributing to the identification of individuals who have been exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). serological test for sars-cov-2 antibody can improve early diagnosis of covid-19 and serves as a valuable supplement to rna detection. serological tests have been proposed as reliable tools for detecting coronavirus sars-cov-2 antibodies in infected patients, especially for surveillance or epidemiological purposes. sars-cov-2 antibodies were measured with the biosynex covid-19 bss igm/igg test (biosynex, illkirch-graffenstaden, france) and the maglumi clia (igm and igg) (snibe - shenzhen new industries biomedical engineering, shenzhen, china) in 70 serum samples from patients with pcr-confirmed diagnosis. this response to covid-19 can be monitored based on the production of antibodies, and thus, serologic tests have become available for diagnostic purposes. we report on the validation of the vitros anti-sars-cov-2 total (cov2t) assay for qualitative serologic testing of sars-cov-2 antibodies. besides sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing, serological testing is emerging as additional option in covid-19 diagnostics. aim of this study was to evaluate novel immunoassays for detection of sars-cov-2 antibodies in human plasma. laboratory testing for the sars-cov-2 virus and the consequent respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is categorized into methods that detect the viral presence and methods that detect antibodies produced in the host as a response to infection. in the coronavirus (cov) disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, highly selective serological testing is essential to define exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 (sars-cov-2). 
If the virus causes blood clots & if the vaxx can cause blood clots in some, wouldn't indiscriminate vaxx in the recently infected cause an even higher risk of clots?      think anyone at   cares?  https://t.co/FicR4O63qG [SEP] we provide evidence that hev can be transmitted by cryosupernatant plasma, and that hev infection can act as a trigger for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp). although some viruses are benign in pregnancy, others can have serious consequences. a well recognized hazard of transfusion with blood or blood products is the acquisition of a viral infection. although a risk of transfusion-transmitted human parvovirus b19v (tt-b19v) infection has been a concern, there have been very few reports of clinically relevant tt-b19v caused by the transfusion of a b19v-containing blood component. clotting factor concentrates prepared from human plasma are a potential route of parvovirus b19 (b19) infection in patients with coagulation disorders. however, it is not clear whether b19 transmits and persistently infects patients with haemophilia, especially those with hiv infection. the levels of anti-b19 igg were significantly higher in haemophiliacs than in healthy donors, whereas there was no difference between the level of anti-b19 igg in haemophiliacs with hiv infection and those without hiv infection. moreover, there was no difference between the level of anti-b19 igg in haemophiliacs receiving recombinant factor viii and that in those receiving plasma-derived clotting factors. the hev seroprevalence in blood donors and recipients of coagulation factor concentrates was compared to obtain evidence of whether a transmission of hev by coagulation factor concentrates could occur. hev seroprevalence was significantly higher in the blood donors than in the patients with a history of coagulation factor concentrate administration. 
Australia's vaccine roll-out setbacks take shine off its Covid-19 success: April 16, 2021 10:00 AMHeavy reliance on the AstraZeneca shot, which may cause blood clots, and lack of information on supply have drawn… https://t.co/HvcYwmnH1Q #guestpost #lastminutenews #guestposting https://t.co/OpkJh3dxM8 [SEP] varicella vaccine has been available in australia since 1999 and, since november 2005, has been funded under the national immunisation program for use in all children as a single dose at 18 months of age and in a school-based catch-up program at 10-13 years of age. recent hospitalization data from australia show a decline in varicella hospitalizations in children 1-4 years of age, most likely related to vaccination. ausvaxsafety, a national vaccine safety surveillance system collected adverse events in young children for 2015 influenza vaccine brands in real time through parent/carer reports via sms/email. this is the second epidemiological report for coronavirus disease (covid-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), reported in australia as at 19:00 australian eastern daylight time [aedt] 8 february 2020. it includes data on australian cases notified during the week ending 19:00 aedt 8 february 2020, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the covid-19 infection. varicella vaccine has been available in australia for 5 years; however, from november 2005, it will be funded for use in all susceptible children at 18 months and 10-13 years of age under the national immunisation program. this review summarizes the epidemiology of vzv-related disease in australia, the use of varicella vaccine and the international experience with vaccine efficacy and safety. ausvaxsafety participant-based surveillance actively monitors adverse events following immunisation (aefi) in australia. the covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy and health system of most countries in the world and this is also true of australia. the learnings from covid-19 should help prepare australia for future pandemics or other major health crises. 
 The immune response to COVID can kill (see cytokine storm and note that both the virus and the vaccine can cause clotting) so why are we deliberately creating immune responses with vaccinations? The vaccine is just another way that people can initiate the deadly immune response [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. the impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective covid-19 vaccine. the development of a massively producible vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel coronavirus, is essential for stopping the current coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic. certainly, the development of such vaccine candidate could possibly be an effective therapy for covid-19. a safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. to control and prevent the current covid-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. vaccines are needed to protect from sars-cov-2, the virus causing covid-19. vaccines that induce large quantities of high affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies may optimally prevent infection and avoid unfavorable effects. 
Cytokine storms occur when the body’s immune system attacks itself, and has been noted as a leading cause of death in patients suffering infected with #Covid-19.  https://t.co/pfmd08gNtA [SEP] cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli. the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex. certain evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic, the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the cytokine storm in their bodies. this article reviews the occurrence mechanism and treatment strategies of the covid-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment. cytokine storm in covid-19 infection is an excessive immune response to external stimuli where the pathogenesis is complex. emerging results indicate that an uncontrolled host immune response, leading to a life-threatening condition called cytokine release syndrome (also termed "cytokine storm"), is the major driver of pathology in severe covid-19. cytokine storm is a life-threatening complication of covid-19 infection. a major underlying cause of covid-19 mortality is a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in severe/critically ill patients. this spectrum of hyperinflammation in covid-19 is commonly referred to as cytokine storm syndrome (css). morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are due in large part to severe cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state brought on by dysregulated host-inflammatory immune response, ultimately leading to multi-organ failure. 
How the vaccine works: The Pfizer/BioTech COVID-19 vaccine contains the Messenger RNA which is packaged in a lipid envelop that allows the messenger RNA to enter the cells. This will cause the cells to produce the COVID-19 cell protein. When the protein is released from the cells [SEP] some of the most advanced vaccine candidates are mrnas encapsulated into lipid carriers, and small liposomes are expected to accumulate in tumour tissues through the enhanced and permeation retention effect. an inexpensive readily manufactured covid-19 vaccine that protects against severe disease is needed to combat the pandemic. we have employed the lvs δ capb vector platform, previously used successfully to generate potent vaccines against the select agents of tularemia, anthrax, plague, and melioidosis, to generate a covid-19 vaccine. we generated vaccines expressing sars-cov-2 structural proteins and evaluated them for efficacy in the golden syrian hamster, which develops severe covid-19 disease. we aimed at designing a peptide vaccine for covid-19 particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes inducing the immune system. there is an urgent need for vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) because of the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic. here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mrna (mrna-lnp) encoding the receptor binding domain (rbd) of sars-cov-2 as a vaccine candidate (called arcov). in developing a covid-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for mers-cov to produce a prefusion-stabilized sars-cov-2 spike protein, s-2p. consequently, this study aims to predict a potential covid-19 peptide-based vaccine utilizing the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (n) and spike glycoprotein (s) via the immunoinformatics approach. several polypeptides are secreted into the medium of cells infected with vaccinia virus, a cytoplasmic dna virus belonging to the poxvirus family. 
Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the USA, more Americans are dying with Covid-19 than Ischemic heart disease, Lung cancer, or COPD! We need Herd immunity from 70-80% of the population vaccinated! [SEP] the u.s. has the highest number of coronavirus disease (covid-19) cases and deaths of any nation. the coronavirus 19 (covid-19) pandemic has overwhelmed our healthcare systems and caused the deaths of tens of thousands of americans. with no known treatments or vaccine, covid-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. covid-19 has emerged as a pandemic of significance with potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. the covid-19 pandemic is currently a major global public health problem. amid of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, much emphasis was initially placed on the elderly or those who have preexisting health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as being at high risk of contracting and/or dying of covid-19. in the united states and europe the mortality rate of elderly patients with covid-19 is greater than 30%. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is causing problems worldwide. elevated susceptibility and death rates in elderly covid-19 patients, especially those with age-related complications, are challenges for pandemic prevention and control. the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) has been a global pandemic and caused thousands of deaths worldwide. 
In some cases, long Covid could mean lifelong Covid = lung damage, heart damage and brain damage that can cause memory loss and brain fog, kidney damage, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, loss of taste and smell, anxiety, depression and, above all, fatigue. https://t.co/cZfcObJGOA [SEP] for some patients, their cognitive impairment may be transient, but for a subgroup, these symptoms can be long-standing and have a major impact on the quality of life. chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (cfs/me) is characterised by severe prolonged fatigue, and decreases in cognition and other physiological functions, resulting in severe loss of quality of life, difficult clinical management and high costs to the health care system. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a common chronic respiratory disease that in the long term may develop into respiratory failure or even cause death and may coexist with other diseases. over time, it may incur huge medical expenses, resulting in a heavy socio-economy burden. these cognitive impairments and psychiatric disorders are profound and long-lasting, adversely affecting survivors' daily functioning, ability to return to work, and quality of life, as well as altering the lives of their family members. long-term care facility (ltcf) residents are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with infection with sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), given their age and high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, combined with functional impairment that often requires frequent, close contact with health care providers, who might inadvertently spread the virus to residents (1,2). a substantial number of individuals have long-lasting adverse effects from a traumatic brain injury (tbi). depression is one of these long-term complications that influences many aspects of life. critical illness can and often does lead to significant cognitive impairment and to the development of psychological disorders. critical illness can and often does lead to significant cognitive impairment and to the development of psychological disorders. 
  Covid just became the 6th leading cause of death in ohio. Is there a reason we aren't trying to stop Heart disease? [SEP] the incidence of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure is increasing. coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. in the united states, approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in 2007 was caused by coronary heart disease. despite various advances in treatment options, including percutaneous coronary intervention, ischemic heart disease still carries a significant morbidity and mortality. recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention show that sudden cardiac death accounts for approximately 400,000 deaths annually in this country. because of the low probability of survival from a cardiac arrest, there has been an increasing focus on primary prevention. a history of cardiovascular comorbidity or experiencing acute cardiac injury during the coronavirus disease 2019 is accompanied by a poor prognosis. therefore, particular consideration is needed to protect the cardiovascular system during this pandemic. we strongly believe that relying solely upon ameliorating myocardial ischemia by coronary revascularization may be an inadequate clinical strategy for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (scd) in dialysis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients. progression of heart failure ("expected mortality") and sudden cardiac death ("unexpected mortality"), presumably secondary to ventricular arrhythmia, are the major causes for the poor prognosis in chronic heart failure (chf). 
Animals and #COVID19[NEWLINE]The virus that causes COVID-19 is different than other coronaviruses that affect domestic animals. Learn how to keep pets and livestock, as well as yourself, safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/jTwdvBhDPM [SEP] these animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against covid-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. diverse coronaviruses can infect the domestic species from dogs and cats, to cattle and pigs to poultry. two major livestock species suffer from economically significant and severe coronavirus diseases. coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause different symptoms, from mild cold to severe respiratory distress, and they can be seen in different types of animals such as camels, cattle, cats and bats. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic continues to pose a global threat to the human population. animals are involved in the covid-19 pandemic. while the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) continues to wreak havoc, there is little known about the susceptibility of the livestock and companion animals relative to humans. sars-cov-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), is suspected to have been first contracted via animal-human interactions; it has further spread across the world by efficient human-to-human transmission. recent reports of covid-19 in companion animals (dogs and cats) and wild carnivores such as tigers have created a dilemma regarding its zoonotic transmission. coronaviruses (cov) have caused a number of major epidemics in humans and animals, including the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which has brought a renewed focus on the evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. 
   What do you consider minute? 3%?[NEWLINE]Then there's long covid that can include fatigue, lung damage, heart damage, secondary infection, thrombosis and nerve damage.[NEWLINE]All can cause severe after effects and in some cases, death after the 28 day cut off for reporting covid deaths. [SEP] severe disability greatly diminishes quality of life and often leads to a protracted period of long-term care or death, yet the processes underlying severe disability have not been fully evaluated. a third of the patients surviving the acute phase will develop pulmonary complications. despite well-conducted treatment, in most cases, lung injury often leads to chronic respiratory failure. poor therapeutic compliance result in chronic respiratory failure and after 7 years of follow-up, pulmonary transplant remains the only long-term alternative. close monitoring of respiratory symptoms in the course of toxic epidermal necrosis, intense treatment as soon as they appear and a long-term follow-up are essential to postpone chronic respiratory failure. the magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic will result in substantial neurological disease, whether through direct infection (rare), para-infectious complications (less rare), or critical illness more generally (common). here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of covid-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions. additional to the direct neurological complications of covid-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial covid-19 infection. adverse effects associated with difficult airway management can be catastrophic and include death, brain injury and myocardial injury. closed-malpractice claims have shown prolonged and persistent attempts at endotracheal intubation to be the most common situation leading to disastrous respiratory events. 
Researchers believe that the inflammation may lead to heart failure.- German Study[NEWLINE]COVID-19 may increase the risk of blood clots, which may cause heart damage or heart attacks in some people. [SEP] it is clear that existing cardiovascular disease is a major risk factor for covid-19 and related adverse outcomes. in addition to acute respiratory syndrome, a large cohort also develop myocardial or vascular dysfunction, in part from inflammation and renin angiotensin system activation with increased sympathetic outflow, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemia, heart failure, and thromboembolic complications that portend poor outcomes related to covid-19. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) increases the risk of several non-pulmonary complications such as acute myocardial injury, renal failure or thromboembolic events. endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of the key comorbidities that increase risk for severe covid-19 such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or heart failure. the proinflammatory cytokine storm associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) negatively affects the hematological system, leading to coagulation activation and endothelial dysfunction and thereby increasing the risk of venous and arterial thrombosis. poor vascular health, which is associated with the cardiometabolic health conditions frequently reported in people with severer forms of covid-19, might exacerbate the risk of coagulopathy and mortality. numerous recent studies have shown that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (cvd) are at increased risk of more severe clinical course as well as mortality of covid-19. also, the available data suggests that covid-19 is related to numerous de novo cardiovascular complications especially in the older population and those with pre-existing chronic cardiometabolic conditions. sars-cov-2 virus can cause acute cardiovascular injury, as well as increase the risk of chronic cardiovascular damage. in addition, we review the pediatric population, the major cause of the cardiovascular complications is pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome that is believed to be associated with covid-19 infection.

CCNY  student Clarence Kong explains how the vaccines work and exactly why they cannot cause COVID-19 infection. #VaxUpCUNY #VaccinesSaveLives https://t.co/1JvDAZgRhP [SEP] this paper describes the development and acceptability of "vaxchat," an hour-long, evidence-based video tutorial aimed at improving obstetric care providers' ability to promote maternal vaccines. influenza vaccine is not included in the hong kong government's universal childhood immunisation programme but eligible children can receive subsidised vaccine through the private sector using the vaccination subsidy scheme (vss). this study examined whether a simple intervention package can increase influenza vaccine uptake in hong kong children. the development of covid-19 vaccines is occurring at a rapid pace, with the potential for a vaccine to be available within 6 months. the authors examined the relative effectiveness of gain-versus loss-framed messages in promoting acceptance of a vaccine against human papillomavirus (hpv)-a virus responsible for virtually all cases of cervical cancer. to control the covid-19 pandemic, governments need to ensure a successful large-scale administration of covid-19 vaccines when safe and efficacious vaccines become available. for college students who are embracing a digital era and being exposed to multimedia, the sources of covid-19 vaccine information and their trust in these sources may play an important role in shaping their acceptance of vaccine uptake. descriptive analysis and linear regression analysis were used to investigate vaccine information sources among college students and examine how covid-19 vaccine acceptance was associated with information source and trust level in each source. effective strategies are needed to disseminate accurate information about covid-19 vaccine from health authorities and scientific research to improve vaccine communication to the public and promote covid-19 vaccine uptake. vaccine-preventable diseases significantly influence the health and academic success of college students. 
  Are you aware that the vaccines could cause miscarriage? The real data regarding covid is that there are tiny numbers, percentage wise, of generally healthy people under the age of 60 that die from COVID or that get admitted into ICU. Are you worried about cancer too? https://t.co/gFOUxRcWTW [SEP] the highly prevalent cervical cancer can be prevented through a vaccine. the hpv vaccine is an important vaccine for childhood cancer survivors because of their risks of second cancers, yet few survivors receive it. we examined hpv vaccine knowledge among caregivers of childhood cancer survivors, whether their child had received the vaccine, and their intentions to vaccinate. among caregivers whose child had not yet gotten the hpv vaccine, approximately 30% stated they were not likely to get the vaccine for their child and the most commonly cited reason was not enough information (25.2%). provider discussion about vaccines and side effects (relative risk (rr) = 1.85, 95% ci 1.16-2.94), along with recommendations regarding vaccines after cancer treatment (rr = 1.35, 95% ci 1.06-1.72), led to greater caregiver intention to get the hpv vaccine for their child with cancer. our findings demonstrate a need for oncology-focused interventions to educate families of childhood cancer survivors about the importance of the hpv vaccine after cancer therapy. vaccines remain an effective yet controversial method for preventing infectious diseases like those caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) and pandemic influenza (h1n1). however, reports of postvaccination serious adverse events such as autoimmunity, although rare, have caused great concerns among the general public. young cancer survivors are at increased risk for morbidities related to infection with the human papillomavirus (hpv), yet their hpv vaccine initiation rates remain low. how best, then, to tackle these concerns and increase public confidence in the vaccine safety system? 
 I think systemically injecting spike protein causes an exaggerated immune response that is identical 2systemic COVID infection in frail elderly. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The immune response does the damage only this time because it’s injected systemically bypassing the innate system we see ICU & death. [SEP] a prominent feature of severe streptococcal infections is the profound inflammatory response that contributes to systemic toxicity. severe infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov)-2 is characterized by massive cytokine release and t cell loss. the exaggerated host immune response, incapable of viral clearance, instead aggravates respiratory distress, as well as cardiac, and/or damage to other organs. the mortality pattern of sars-cov-2 infection, higher in older versus younger adults and almost absent in children, is possibly caused by the effects of age and pre-existing comorbidities on innate and adaptive immunity. here, we speculate that the abnormal and excessive immune response to sars-cov-2 infection partly depends on t cell immunological memory, which is more pronounced in adults compared with children, and may significantly contribute to immunopathology and massive collateral damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients. the virus infects host cells using its spike glycoprotein (s-protein) and has significantly higher infectivity and mortality rates among the aged population. sepsis is one of the leading causes of death around the world. the condition occurs when a local infection overcomes the host natural defense mechanism and suddenly spreads into the circulatory system, triggering a vigorous, self-injurious inflammatory host response. progressive immune-associated injury is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). viral evasion of innate immunity, hypercytokinemia and systemic immunopathology in the sars coronavirus (sars cov) infected host have been suggested as possible mechanisms for the cause of severe pathology and morbidity in sars patients. 
 in addition to that,  covid is viral in nature — no antibiotic can ever kill viral pathogens.  antibiotics are used if there is a bacterial cause and not viral cause.  i hope i made that clear. [SEP] as antibiotics are only effective if the infection is caused by bacteria, they are not recommended in most cases. however, prescribing for respiratory tract infections in primary care is not an exact science, and deciding whether an infection is viral or bacterial is often down to individual clinicians. acute bronchitis is usually a viral infection which, unless there is a special disposition, does not require antibiotic therapy. antiviral drugs do not currently exist for the treatment of enterovirus infections, which are often severe and potentially life-threatening. in our current state of knowledge and medical practice, specific antiviral agents are not used in the treatment of known or presumed viral diarrhea. viral infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly people and young children throughout the world. however, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. bacteriophages are viruses that kill bacteria. until recently, there were no effective drugs available blocking coronavirus (cov) infection in humans and animals. collectively, our results uncover cyclophilin a as a host target for cov infection and provide new strategies for urgently needed therapeutic approaches. 
Certain diseases like CHF, COPD, and some viral illnesses like COVID-19 can cause an increased risk for hospital readmissions. Our signature wellness programs, like Just Breathe, can help your patients stay out of the hospital. #chf #copd #COVID19 #respiratorycare #healthcare https://t.co/a966Shb0wl [SEP] patients with congestive heart failure (chf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) account for most 30-day hospital readmissions nationwide. eligible patients were admitted with chf or copd and had at least one additional risk for readmission. hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of copd (aecopds) pose burdens to the health-care system and patients. patients hospitalized for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations have high rehospitalization rates and reduced quality of life. this study was conceived to test whether coordinated discharge and post-discharge care could reduce re-hospitalizations and use of resources in patients with copd. hospital readmission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) has attracted attention owing to the burden to patients and the health care system. to determine the effect of comprehensive health coaching on the rate of copd readmissions. the absolute risk reductions of copd-related rehospitalization in the health coaching group were 7.5% (p = 0.01), 11.0% (p = 0.02), 11.6% (p = 0.03), 11.4% (p = 0.05), and 5.4% (p = 0.24) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, compared with the control group. health coaching may represent a feasible and possibly effective intervention designed to reduce copd readmissions. a focus of copd interventional studies is directed towards prevention of exacerbations leading to hospital readmissions. 
  Sad enough Covid-19 can cause SOME cardiovascular Diseases, and it has only been 7-8 months since the first case, with no vaccine in sight, things are going to get worse, the numbers will rise even more.. [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has caused serious damage to public health. covid-19, as an infectious disease, has shocked the world and still threatens the lives of billions of people. the sudden outburst of coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) poses a massive threat to global public health. covid-19 is a global threat that pushes health care to its limits. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an emerging infectious disease that spreads around the world. the lack of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, along with the relatively high mortality rate and high contagiousness, has raised strong public concerns over covid-19, especially for people living in the most severely affected areas. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been particularly severe on older people. the latest version of human coronavirus said to be covid-19 came out as a sudden pandemic disease within human population and in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment till date, it daunting threats heavily to human lives, infecting more than 12, 11, 214 people and death more than 67, 666 people in 208 countries across the globe as on april 06, 2020, which is highly alarming. covid-19 has been one of the worst public health calamities faced by humankind in over a century. respiratory viral infections such as coronavirus (covid-19) will cause a great mortality, especially in people who underly lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and asthma. 
 COVID is also known to cause myocarditis, so it seems likely to me that this is caused by the spike protein, or an allergic reaction to the spike protein. Seems wrong to call it a side effect of the vaccine, per se. [SEP] the spike (s) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus (cov), the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). vaccine development for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) has mainly focused on the spike (s) protein. human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19)-related myocarditis cases have been reported. the pathophysiology of covid-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. covid-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. because many covid-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. the long-term impact of covid-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown. the most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. the outbreak of coronavirus disease (covid-19) was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), through its surface spike glycoprotein (s-protein) recognition on the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) in humans. however, some animal studies have suggested that inadequate immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) induces a lung eosinophilic immunopathology upon infection. 
                                                 Covid causes blood clots that cause heart attack, stroke, general organ damage and affect cognition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are also much more vulnerable to dying from this damage if your circulatory system is already compromised by diabetes, obesity etc. [SEP] most patients with critical limb ischemia (cli) have co-existing coronary heart disease, which is the main cause of their increased mortality. cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors in the development of cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease (ad). cardiovascular illness, the major cause of morbidity and mortality among these patients, encompasses macrovascular disease, with heart attacks, strokes, and gangrene; and microvascular disease, with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (somatic and autonomic). diabetic complications result in much morbidity and mortality and considerable consumption of scarce medical resources. the effects of diabetes on the central nervous system (cns) result in cognitive dysfunction and cerebrovascular disease. the presence of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in type 1 diabetes largely impairs life expectancy. hyperglycemia and its vascular complications affect the entire nervous system, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. chronic hyperglycemia is not only a known and major risk factor for cerebral vascular diseases but also the presence of hyperglycemia at the time of a cerebrovascular event may adversely influence the outcome. thus diabetes not only increases the risk of coronary heart disease but also increases the case fatality rate, ensuring that the majority of patients die of cardiovascular causes, often before the age of 50 years. a chronic increase of oxidative stress is typical of serious pathologies such as myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), type ii-diabetes, age-related macular degeneration leads to an epic increase of morbidity and mortality in all countries of the world. 
cause of cognitive injury could be seen if the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes covid-19, crosses the blood-brain barrier and directly attacks neural tissue [SEP] objective: sars-cov-2 infection and its oft-associated illness covid-19 may lead to neuropsychological deficits, either through direct mechanisms (i.e., neurovirulance) or indirect mechanisms, most notably complications caused by the virus (e.g., stroke) or medical procedures (e.g., intubation). although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the causal pathogen of covid-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain cells and impact their function is not well understood. while sars-cov-2, the causal pathogen of covid-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain cells and impact their function are not well understood, and experimental models using human brain cells are urgently needed. the sars-cov-2, virus that caused the covid-19 global pandemic, possesses a neuroinvasive potential. moreover, covid-19 is associated with several neurological diseases and complications, which may eventually affect clinical outcomes. the brain is among the targets of covid-19, and it can be impacted in multiple ways, both directly and indirectly. in this article, we highlight the impact of sars-cov-2 (the coronavirus causing covid-19) on the central nervous system as there is an urgent need to understand the longitudinal impacts of covid-19 on brain function, behaviour and cognition. covid-19 is caused by the coronavirus sars-cov-2 that has an affinity for neural tissue. indeed, neurological sequelae of sars-cov-2 infection have already been reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus (cov) from a translational perspective. however, it is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the causative agent of covid-19, gains access to the cns and whether it causes neuropathological changes. 
Disappointing that  stewards are heavy handed with COVID 19 masking rules, hot weather increases asthma symptoms which could potentially cause health problems for some masked spectators. PA announcements need to take people with exemptions into account!  #ENGvNZ [SEP] after initial assertions that the wearing of face masks was an unnecessary public health tool in the prevention of the spread of covid-19, the advice coming out of the centers for disease control (cdc) suddenly changed. in covid-19 pandemics days, wearing facial mask in public places has become obligatory to prevent the virus spread. wearing masks against 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others. why do many japanese people wear masks during the covid-19 pandemic, even though masks are unlikely to prevent them from getting infected? during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, the general public has been advised to wear masks or improvised face coverings to limit transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). state policies mandating public or community use of face masks or covers in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are hotly contested. this study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus washington, d.c., between april 8 and may 15, 2020. the findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of covid-19. mandates for mask use in public during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, worsened by global shortage of commercial supplies, have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
  Tweeps did share #science when  atributed symptoms requiring urgent medical attention, to #TheCovidMyth that symptoms caused by being in close proximity to vaccinated person.  Symptoms could be fibroids, cervical/ovarian #cancer, menstrual disorders or #COVID19 https://t.co/a1CQiBaAMQ [SEP] however, seemingly inexplicit adverse reactions have been described after the injection of the newer vaccines vs. human papillomavirus (hpv). different isolated cases and small series have described the development of complex regional pain syndrome (crps), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots), and fibromyalgia after hpv vaccination. this article forwards the hypothesis that small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia could be the common underlying pathogenesis to the group of rare, but severe reactions that follow hpv vaccination. clinicians should be aware of the possible association between hpv vaccination and the development of these difficult to diagnose painful dysautonomic syndromes. however, during the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of possible adverse events associated with vaccinations, cultivating heated debates and leading to significant fluctuations in vaccination rates. such adverse reactions to vaccines may be viewed as a result of the interaction between susceptibility of the vaccinated subject and various vaccine components. human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination has been anecdotally connected to the development of dysautonomia, chronic fatigue, complex regional pain syndrome and postural tachycardia syndrome. human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination has been anecdotally connected to development of dysautonomia, chronic fatigue, complex regional pain syndrome and postural tachycardia syndrome. in view of the rapidly growing number of vaccines available and the need to implement massive immunization campaigns in several regions of the world, it is imperative to understand the potential adverse reactions of vaccinations. neurological disorders are among the most serious, and on rare occasions, life-threatening complications after vaccination. 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/2AwZUDJlGn [SEP] background: covid-19 affects not only patients' physical health but also their mental health. for the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by covid-19. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is far reaching, with devastating effects on individuals, communities, and societies across the world. people with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from covid-19. individuals with covid-19 will experience high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, and low quality of life. covid-19 is a syndrome that includes more than just isolated respiratory disease, as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) also interacts with the cardiovascular, nervous, renal, and immune system at multiple levels, increasing morbidity in patients with underlying cardiometabolic conditions and inducing myocardial injury or dysfunction. considering the importance of perception or representation of the disease in a state of social alert, our study intended to validate an instrument measuring the psychological process of the disease caused by the coronavirus (covid-19). the severe form of covid-19 is marked by an abnormal and exacerbated immunological host response favoring to a poor outcome in a significant number of patients, especially those with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. crises such as the global pandemic of covid-19 (coronavirus) elicit a range of responses from individuals and societies adversely affecting physical and emotional well-being. this article provides an overview of factors elicited in response to covid-19 and their impact on immunity, physical health, mental health and well-being. 
 What Pfizer or the CDC will not tell you is that the vaccine could cause every single symptom of COVID and you could lose a week+ of your life trying to recover from the things that’s suppose to “protect” you from COVID [SEP] despite the ability to dampen the spread of sars-cov-2, the causative agent of the diseases, through restrictive interventions, it is believed that only effective vaccines will provide sufficient control over the disease and revert societal live back to normal. without vaccination, chickenpox (varicella) will affect almost every person in the world during their lifetime. this article reviews data from extensive worldwide experience with the refrigerator-stable version of the vaccine, including information derived from its use in over 10,000 individuals participating in clinical trials investigating its immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness, and safety, as well as postmarketing data including its use in universal mass vaccination programs. covid-19, a global pandemic, has caused over 750,000 deaths worldwide as of august 2020. sars-cov-2, whose symptoms include difficulty swallowing, coughing, diarrhea, and breathing failure, has caused the loss of many lives around the world. antiviral agents will be unavailable to most people and vaccines are regarded as the mainstay of protection. the current covid-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after covid-19. most people who fall sick with covid-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. the covid-19 pandemic has not only had a negative impact on people's health and life behavior, but also on economies around the world. 
   the vaccine can cause heart and brain issues too...maybe even cancer. Its been giving women fertility issues. We won't know till like 10yrs down the road any other side effects of this which could be same or worse than just getting covid immunity naturally. Remember Pox Parties? [SEP] adverse events following immunization, while rare, unfortunately do occur. however, reports of postvaccination serious adverse events such as autoimmunity, although rare, have caused great concerns among the general public. yet, given the high vaccine coverage rates in the united states, the public is increasingly becoming concerned that vaccines may be causing immediate or long-term health problems and less concerned about the possibility of becoming infected. throughout the history of vaccination, vaccines have been accused of harmful side effects. one of the major factors contributing to parental refusal of vaccinations is the perception that vaccines cause side effects. although symptoms are commonly reported following vaccinations, their causes are not always straightforward. controversies regarding vaccine components and side effects have misled parents to believe that vaccines might be harmful based on inaccurate data from the internet, celebrities, as well as misinterpreted and frankly bad science. this belief of vaccines being harmful has led to fear and decreased immunization rates in spite of sound scientific evidence supporting the safety of vaccines and their lack of association with autism, developmental disabilities or other medical disorders. this increases the risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases and disrupting herd immunity, and also impairs the trust in the capacities of health care systems to protect people. this high involvement might lead to parents overemphasizing the potential side effects that they know to be vaccine-related, and by amplifying those, parents are more focused on the potential outcomes of vaccine-related decisions, which can yield specific pattern of the outcome bias. 
5/ In other words, the authors (who work at Oxford, home of the  vaccine) appear to have wanted to prove Covid-19 was more likely to cause these clots than vaccines.  BUT THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MRNA VACCINES ARE NEARLY AS LIKELY TO CAUSE CLOTS AS THE DNA VACCINES... [SEP] this article draws on a broadcast popular among the anti-vaccine community to map out six themes used by the broadcast to mislead viewers about covid-19. case series without control groups suggest that covid-19 may cause ischemic stroke, but whether covid-19 is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke than would be expected from a viral respiratory infection is uncertain. to compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with covid-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously linked to stroke. after adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was significantly higher with covid-19 than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% ci, 2.3-24.9). approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. as the reasons for the increase were not clear a study was carried out in five health units to compare the reactions to adsorbed dpt vaccine manufactured by wyeth ltd. and connaught laboratories ltd. and fluid dpt vaccines manufactured by connaught, all the vaccines being injected in the anterolateral thigh. from the responses on 1619 questionnaires that the parents of vaccinated children had completed it was found that the relative risk of a reaction was higher with the fluid than with the adsorbed connaught vaccine (1.7 for redness and 1.8 for swelling on the day of vaccination but 1.0 for drowsiness and 1.3 for persistent crying). the size and duration of local redness and swelling were also greater with the fluid than with the adsorbed connaught vaccines. a great deal of controversy has recently been generated over the publication of several articles implicating measles vaccine in the induction of crohn's disease and autism. the publication of this work has already had a negative impact on measles vaccine acceptance in the uk. 
  COVID-19:[NEWLINE]1) directly causes viral pneumonia[NEWLINE]2) can create environment conducive to development of secondary bacterial pneumonia [NEWLINE]3) can result in intubation, creating risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory failure. the novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely covid-19, has become a global public health problem. novel 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) infection usually causes a respiratory disease that may vary in severity from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia with multiple organ failure. covid-19 disease is a viral illness that predominantly causes pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. airway management of patients with covid-19 is high risk to staff and patients. this manuscript aims to highlight the risk of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (vap) in covid-19 inpatients. the co-infection has the potential to worsen clinical condition and increase mortality in these patients, as well as to prolong and increase the costs of hospitalization. in addition to the widely described respiratory syndrome, covid-19 may cause life-treating complications directly or indirectly related to this infection. among these, thrombotic complications have emerged as an important issue in patients with covid-19 infection, particularly in patients in intensive care units. infection can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, from an asymptomatic condition to severe bilateral pneumonia and life-threatening conditions. 
  now that we have that out of the way. yes, people can say that a heart attack is "covid-19", and they're probably wrong. then again, covid-19 can cause failure's in organs. and a heart attack could occur from that i think? she could have also had covid, and had a heart attack. [SEP] furthermore, covid-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. the cardiovascular interactions of covid-19 have similarities to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, middle east respiratory syndrome and influenza. covid-19, a disease initially thought to be prominently an interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of severity, can be considered a vascular disease with regards to serious complications and causes of mortality. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has caused a global pandemic which has affected patients and healthcare systems around the world. patients with established cardiovascular diseases have a poor prognosis when affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). also, the cardiovascular system, especially the heart, is affected by covid-19. we describe a case of severe arterial thrombosis induced by covid-19 infection along with its pathological implications. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is challenging the care for cardiovascular patients, resulting in serious consequences with increasing mortality in pre-diseased heart failure patients. in the current state of the pandemic, the physiopathology of covid-19 affecting pre-diseased hearts and the management of terminal heart failure in covid-19 patients remain unclear. we conclude that covid-19 directly affects pre-diseased hearts, but the consequences can be treated successfully with lvad implantation. 
I don’t think it’s that outlandish to assume that any lingering inflammation caused by covid infection would reignite briefly after the vaccine. Both cause a generalized inflammatory response. While vaccine can be more noticeable than the virus, it’s controlled & short-lived. 3/ [SEP] most vaccines are designed as a prophylactic measure, that is, to stimulate the immune response so that on subsequent exposure to the particular infectious agent, the extent of infection in the vaccinated individual is so low that disease does not occur. there is increasing enthusiasm and optimism that a vaccine could be developed that prevents infection rather than disease. a more effective influenza virus vaccine must be capable of inducing a greater degree of protection against the disease while causing fewer unwanted side effects. the only side effects noted were mild rhinorrhea and sore throat in 3 vaccinees. there was no evidence of vaccine virus having been transmitted from a vaccinee to a control individual.a 4-fold or greater rise in serum antibody was noted in 13/19 vaccinees following either the 1st or 2nd dose. prophylactic vaccinations may sometimes shorten the incubation period of some illnesses and/or convert a latent infection/inflammation into a clinically apparent disease. it is suggested that the whole-cell pertussis present in dtp vaccine, acting as an excessive stimulus in these patients, produced symptoms reminiscent of biologic responses to circulating proinflammatory monokines such as il-1beta, tnf-alpha, and il-6 because earlier it was reported that in vitro the whole-cell vaccine induced significantly more such cytokine production than did the acellular pertussis or diphtheria-tetanus-only vaccine. adverse reactions to vaccines are generally mild; severe events resulting in death or permanent damage are rare. severe immunologically mediated reactions are rare and less common with the vaccine than the true infection. for acute self-limiting infections a vaccine is successful if it elicits memory at least as good as the natural experience; however, for persistent and chronic infections such as hiv, hepatitis c virus (hcv), human papillomavirus (hpv), and human herpes viruses, this paradigm is not applicable. 
Ladies, you should know about this👉’ Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can cause temporary lymph node enlargement and result in a “false positive” mammogram’. 👈 we found this out the hard way. [SEP] the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population. little is known about covid-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. with the introduction of the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccine, it is unknown whether these emotions will have altered or whether the information needs of vaccinated women will have changed. with increasing numbers of vaccinated women entering the screening programme, it is timely to review the information available to these women. in the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic era, it is essential to rule out covid-19 effectively to prevent transmission in both communities and medical facilities. according to previous reports in high prevalence areas, ct screening may be useful in the diagnosis of covid-19. amidst the covid-19 pandemic, clinicians have been plagued with dilemmas related to the uncertainty about diagnostic testing for the virus. it has become commonplace for a patient under investigation (pui) to repeatedly test negative but have imaging findings that are consistent with covid-19. cervical cancer screening will inevitably lead to unintentional harmful effects e.g. furthermore, it is not clear whether this infection will increase the risk of congenital monstrosity, foetal growth restriction, premature delivery or cause other long-term adverse effects. 
  Just b/c Covid-19 causes symptoms that look like the flu on the outside, we already know internal effects are different. How many kids & young people have silent cardiac damage? Can SARS-CoV-2 cause persistent or latent infection? (Google: persistent virus) [SEP] coronavirus disease -2019 (covid-19) is a recently described infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) with significant cardiovascular implications. although infection with sars-cov-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or kawasaki disease. covid-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus named as sars-cov-2. sars-cov-2 viruses are positive single-stranded rna viruses, whose infection can be asymptomatic or lead to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications. in this review, we summarise the cardiac manifestations of covid-19 infection and propose a simplified algorithm for patient management during the covid-19 pandemic. the disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is usually mild and self-limiting in previously healthy children, but they may also develop severe disease. covid-19, the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 virus, can cause shortness of breath, lung damage, and impaired respiratory function. covid-19 is defined by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications including viral myocarditis are also prevalent. although ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by covid-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of sars-cov-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well understood. 
 Rubbish! this is all based on a flawed testing method that produces false positive results! Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] the ongoing global novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 outbreak has engendered numerous cases of infection and death. covid-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, currently recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates and are unable to identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. parallel testing with approved real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kits for sars-cov-2 and nts using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected covid-19 cases show that nts identifies more infected patients (22/61) as positive, while also effectively monitoring for mutated nucleic acid sequences, categorizing types of sars-cov-2, and detecting other respiratory viruses in the test sample. multiple polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) is considered the gold standard diagnostic investigation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). during the height of the pandemic in italy (march to may 2020), these patients underwent chest computed tomography (ct) scans that showed lung alterations typical of covid-19 with multiple negative rt-pcr tests and positive serology for sars-cov-2. these cases suggest that in the covid-19 pandemic period, to provide an earlier specific treatment in patients with positive serology, a chest ct scan can be useful in those presenting with a fever or a history of fever associated with persistent mild respiratory symptoms or with abdominal complaints despite repeated negative rt-pcr results. the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) around the world is a tragic and shocking event that demonstrates the unpreparedness of humans to develop quick diagnostic platforms for novel infectious diseases. finally, current challenges and future perspective for the development of diagnostic or monitoring technologies in the control of covid-19 are discussed to persuade the scientists in advancing their technologies beyond imagination. the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) has been questioned due to negative results in some patients who were strongly suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the aim of our study was to analyze the prognosis of infected patients with initial negative rt-pcr in the emergency department (ed) during the covid-19 outbreak. 
   SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Though COVID-19 can cause this, the condition COVID-19 infection resulting in ICU admission with respiratory support is more accurately called ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] bc it results in alveolar injury. #My$0.02 [SEP] covid-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is associated with significant morbidity and high levels of mortality. this paper describes the processes involved in the pathophysiology of covid-19 from the initial infection and subsequent destruction of type ii alveolar epithelial cells by sars-cov-2 and culminating in the development of ards. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is a form of respiratory failure in human. the number of deaths caused by sars-cov-2 infection inducing this severe pneumonia (ards) is relatively high. in fact, covid-19 might get worsen in ards and provoke respiratory failure. the most severe outcome of the disease is the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) combined with hypoxemia and cardiovascular damage. covid-19 impacts the respiratory system and this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), which increases the likelihood of intensive care unit (icu) admission. covid-19 is an infection induced by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) requiring intensive care unit (icu) management. the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) secondary to viral pneumonitis is one of the main causes of high mortality in patients with covid-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019). covid-19 is an acute infectious respiratory distress syndrome (ards) caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. 
        (continued) as well as pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as diabetes and obesity ( here ).  SO, I will add, if someone had asthma and managed it their whole life then gets Covid and dies,  the Covid is what caused The death. [SEP] hypertension, diabetes and heart disease are the most common comorbidities in patients with covid-19. there is a high prevalence of comorbidities (83%) among patients who died from covid-19 in brazil, with heart disease being the most prevalent. although the virus can cause disease in anyone, it is particularly dangerous for those with various "co-morbidities" such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and others. patients with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to have severe illness due to covid-19 and are at increased risk for complications and mortality. amid of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, much emphasis was initially placed on the elderly or those who have preexisting health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as being at high risk of contracting and/or dying of covid-19. pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are associated with a greater severity and higher fatality rate of covid-19. in particular, aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, have significantly higher risks of hospitalization and death than normal individuals. age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in covid-19. obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance, which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. covid-19 is associated with an increased mortality in the elderly and particularly those with obesity, hypertension and diabetes, features which are typically seen in patients with osa. 
So the second dose for the covid shot can cause something called covid arm? I totally could use a third arm. You do know where those fingers will be all day? Yep, on Twitter while I work. I bet you thought something else.  *it's about hives and not a 3rd arm [SEP] mobio includes 2 dof at wrist which is rare in other trans-humeral prostheses. through anthropometric features mobio prosthetic arm can achieve elbow flexion/extension, forearm supination/pronation, wrist radial/ulnar deviation, wrist flexion/extension and compound motion of thumb and index finger. it seems to me that the second anniversary of that event merits notice and maybe a small celebration. the mini c-arm is popular with hand surgeons, and they are particularly at risk for radiation exposure, as they cannot easily distance themselves from the radiation beam. two fellowship-trained hand surgeons wore ring dosimeters on both hands during surgeries with mini c-arm fluoroscopy involving bony work of the forearm and hand. a second dose of varicella vaccine is routinely recommended. we report 2 cases of large local reactions after receipt of a second dose of varicella vaccine administered in the thigh. clinicians should continue to administer the second dose of varicella vaccine, but should use the preferred site in the arm. the purpose of this study was to perform a prospective comparison of hand versus eye radiation exposure associated with mini-c-arm utilization and to test the hypothesis that routine mini-c-arm does not yield hand or eye dosages exceeding current recommended levels. the findings suggest that hand and eye exposure associated with mini-c-arm utilization during routine surgery does not approach reported levels of critical radiation loads. 
     How can cardiovascular damage be anecdotal? I believe the science is showing that Covid can cause long term effects. It is the second cause of death. This virus can not be wished away no matter how strong minded you are. [SEP] type b coxsackieviruses (cvb) can cause myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm), a potentially-fatal sequela that has been correlated to the persistence of viral rna. our findings suggest that persistent enteroviral rnas probably do not contribute to ongoing myocardial disease, and are more likely to be the fading remnants of a recent, possibly sub-clinical, primary infection which may have set in motion the process that ultimately ends in dcm. a history of cardiovascular comorbidity or experiencing acute cardiac injury during the coronavirus disease 2019 is accompanied by a poor prognosis. the outbreak of coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. as the covid-19 pandemic continues, more information on the nonrespiratory effects of the coronavirus is obtained. postinfection complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are still unknown, and one of the long-term concerns in infected people are brain pathologies. background the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threatens human health, and the mortality rate is higher in patients who develop myocardial damage. however, the possible risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are not fully known. multivariate analysis showed that age >70 years old (hazard ratio [hr], 2.44; 95% ci, 1.01-5.40), crp (c-reactive protein) >100 mg/l (hr, 1.92; 95% ci, 0.94-3.92), lactate dehydrogenase >300 u/l (hr, 2.67; 95% ci, 1.03-6.90), and lactic acid >3 mmol/l (hr, 3.25; 95% ci, 1.57-6.75) were independent risk factors for myocardial damage in patients with covid-19. coronavirus infection outbreaks have occurred frequently in the last two decades and have led to significant mortality. 
Another “deadly variant” that coincidentally attacks 12& younger right when needing Covid-19 Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA when vaccines are causing blood-clots, heart attacks & heart inflammation. Keep in mind heart disease/ failure is the #1 cause of death in U.S🤡🌎 https://t.co/1QyOgbSgYM [SEP] the health crisis due to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has shocked the world, with more than 1 million infections and casualties. cardiac injury and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (af), are not uncommon in covid-19. coronavirus disease of 2019 (covid-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. although covid-19 clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. novel corona-virus disease 2019 (ncovid 19) is caused by a novel virulent corona virus and leads to potentially fatal virulent pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome. as the coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic marches unrelentingly, more patients with cardiac arrhythmias are emerging due to the effects of the virus on the respiratory and cardiovascular (cv) systems and the systemic inflammation that it incurs, and also as a result of the proarrhythmic effects of covid-19 pharmacotherapies and other drug interactions and the associated autonomic imbalance that enhance arrhythmogenicity. the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has become a severe global acute respiratory pandemic around the world in just a few months with an increasing number of infections and deaths. covid-19 is a highly contagious and fatal disease. severe cases infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), named by the world health organization (who) on feb. 11, 2020, tend to present a hypercatabolic state because of severe systemic consumption, and are susceptible to stress ulcers and even life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. covid-19 is a present-day complex pandemic infection with unpredictable levels of morbidity and mortality in various global populations. 
I have issues with thrombosis & embolisms and stuff and tbh I'm more afraid to get the virus than anything b/c covid is known to cause really bad inflammation,  hypercoagulation, clots etc. Much rather be vaccinated. Better odds. [SEP] the main aim of this review is to clarify the real importance of thrombocytopenia as an adverse event and discuss how it may interfere with recommended vaccination schedules. despite the very high benefit-to-risk ratio of vaccines, the fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in the reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis and diphtheria. vaccinations are important for controlling the spread of disease, yet an increasing number of people are distrustful of vaccines, and choose not to (fully) vaccinate themselves and their children. in contrast, pro-vaccination comments were more authentic, somewhat more tentative, and evidenced higher anxiety words, as well as more references to family and social processes when compared to anti-vaccination comments. in contrast, pro-vaccination comments demonstrated greater comparative anxiety, with a particular focus on family and social processes. despite the spectacular success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, fears about their safety and other anti-vaccination claims are widespread. vaccine side effects) compared to the same bad outcomes resulting from omissions (e.g. as a consequence, vaccines themselves, and not the diseases they help prevent, have now become the focus of fear and anxiety for many. despite the very low risk-to-benefit ratio of vaccines, fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis, and diphtheria. vaccine administration is a very effective tool to prevent infectious diseases, but its powerful stimulus on the immune system has generated the fear of exacerbating previously diagnosed autoimmune diseases. 
Percentage of total cancer deaths are 21.3%.and you're worried about COVID-19?[NEWLINE]Race & sex also play a role in a person’s risk of developing cancer, depending on the type. That said, lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer in both men & women. [SEP] lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the united states and is responsible for 20,000 more deaths yearly in us women than breast cancer. cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, and unfortunately, approximately 22 million us women smoke. mounting evidence suggests that there are significant differences in lung cancer between the sexes. findings from ccc19 and teravolt suggest that patients with cancer may be more likely to die from covid-19 than people in the general population. according to the latest data, lung cancer is one of the most common cancer worldwide, men contributing nearly 21.2% and women 8.6% of all diagnosed cancers. lung cancer (lc) is a major public health problem and it is the most common form of cancer in men. it remains the most common cause of cancer death in men and women. lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the united states. it is also the leading cause of cancer death among men and the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. lung cancer mortality rates in the united states are highest among males, blacks, people of lower socioeconomic status, and in the mid-south (e.g., kentucky, mississippi, arkansas, and tennessee). 
  Covid is turning out to be a vascular virus with respiratory symptoms. Covid causes heart failure and heart attacks. [SEP] coronaviruses (covs) are members of the genus betacoronavirus and the coronaviridiae family responsible for infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), and more recently, coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19). cov infections present mainly as respiratory infections that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). the vast majority of patients in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic primarily present with severe respiratory illness. we report a covid-19 patient who presented with findings of acute coronary syndrome and was found to have purulent fulminant myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade. through review of the available literature, we also highlight the potential mechanisms of cardiac injury in covid-19. coronaviruses (covs), enveloped positive-sense rna viruses, are a group of viruses that cause infections in the human respiratory tract, which can be characterized clinically from mild to fatal. covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications. coronaviruses (cov) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov). coronavirus disease (covid-19) is a novel highly contagious infectious disease caused by the coronavirus sars-cov2. coronaviruses (covs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect. https://t.co/NJQ1EbxP2I [SEP] the association of smell and taste loss with covid-19 has been well demonstrated with high prevalence rates. us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of covid-19. covid-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). many organizations have recognized that covid-19 patients may have sudden loss of smell or taste and have included these symptoms in their diagnostic guidelines. loss of smell and taste are common complaints in patients with the covid-19 disease. loss of taste and smell were common symptomatology of covid-19 disease. many reports by physicians and patients during the 2019 to 2020 pandemic indicate that covid-19 is associated with elevated levels of odor and taste perception disorders (anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia, and/or dysgeusia). this mini review provides fundamental knowledge on coincidence of covid-19 infection and smell-taste perception disorders from an objective perspective. persistent smell and taste disorders have been reported as some of the most common symptoms after covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). an altered sense of smell and taste has been reported to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
‘We made a big mistake’ — COVID vaccine spike protein travels from injection site, can cause organ damage https://t.co/i1nZiEhmiX [SEP] the recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov2) and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international community and has caused widespread public health concerns due to the unavailability of treatment to this deadly disease. the covid -19 has affected healthcare workers badly in the world with front line health care providers has a mortality rate of 1.4%. a disastrous coronavirus, which infects a normal person through droplets of infected person, has a route that is usually by mouth, eyes, nose or hands. intrathecal administration of vincristine is a rare event but catastrophic for the patient, family and clinical team involved. intrathecal administration of vincristine is a rare event but catastrophic for the patient, family and clinical team involved. during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, health-care workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. a 56-year-old man presented a particularly severe and multisystemic case of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). transmission of sars-cov-2 to health care workers (hcw) poses a major burden in the current covid-19 pandemic. unprotected exposure to a covid-19 patient is a key risk factor for hcws. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has caused serious damage to public health. 
Covid seems to wake up the same age-old mechanism in our white blood cells that causes long-term brain and nerve inflammation in multiple sclerosis (an ancient virus that has become part of our DNA). It could explain why certain people get neurological #LongCovid symptoms 🤕 https://t.co/5wnIuiQveQ [SEP] more recent work has suggested that chronic viral infection leaves the host with exaggerated immunity to bacterial infections. in this review, the relationship between cmv and host responses to sepsis are reviewed, with particular attention to the impact that tissue viral load contributes to this phenomenon. here we will address how lifelong cmv infection and the immunological burden of its control might affect immune reactivity and health of the host over time. persistent or repeated infections of the central nervous system (whether subclinical or diagnosable) can cause damage to neurons directly or indirectly through inflammation resulting in incremental neuronal damage, thus eroding cognitive reserve. multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory demyelination disease characterized by autoimmune damage to the central nervous system. emerging data suggest a possible contribution of cmv, known to chronically infect a large proportion of humans, lifelong from newborns to centenarians. these results indicate that cmv represents an important pathogen responsible for a strong immune activation in human aging. latent infection with cytomegalovirus (cmv) is thought to accelerate aging of the immune system. cmv has been associated with several diseases of aging, including vasculopathy and neurocognitive impairment. in fact it has been suggested that chronic cmv infection is a driving force in age-related t cell immunosenescence. 
 Yes! Oral contraceptives cause more blood clots and nobody is doing anything about that!!! Like 1 per 1,000 compared to basically 1 per MILLION with the Covid vaccine. Maddening. [SEP] combined oral contraceptives (cocs) are highly effective when correctly used but unscheduled bleeding, which occurs fairly commonly during the early months, is disruptive for many women. combined oral contraceptives (cocs) increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (vte), particularly among women with inherited clotting disorders. the world health organization classifies combined hormonal contraception as an "unacceptable health risk" for women with thrombogenic mutations but advises against universal thrombophilia screening before prescribing cocs given the low prevalence of thrombophilia and high screening costs. low-dose formulations however, have resulted in increased incidences of breakthrough bleeding and contraceptive failure, particularly when coadministered with inducers of cytochrome p450 enzymes (cyp). although the majority of american women believe that oral contraceptives can cause serious health problems such as cancer or heart disease, the scientific literature does not support these beliefs. the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users, including myocardial infarction, appears to be caused by thrombosis and not atherosclerosis. the studies suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users were published in the late 1970s and therefore used a data base of women ingesting formulations containing 50 micrograms of estrogen or more. nearly all published studies indicate that there is no increased risk of myocardial infarction in former users of oral contraceptives. side effects caused by oral contraceptives discourage compliance with and continuation of oral contraceptives. a suggested disadvantage of biphasic oral contraceptive pills compared to triphasic oral contraceptive pills is an increase in breakthrough bleeding. 
  Vaccines allow you to build immunity without suffering the damaging effects of the disease itself. COVID-19 can cause serious long-term health problems and even be fatal. All of this can be avoided by getting vaccinated.  https://t.co/segNhg4ePd [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. the impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective covid-19 vaccine. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. in this observational population-based study we examined intentions to be vaccinated against covid-19 over the course of the pandemic. currently, there are no vaccines available for covid-19, and the most effective way to curb its spread is to follow preventive practices. despite the ability to dampen the spread of sars-cov-2, the causative agent of the diseases, through restrictive interventions, it is believed that only effective vaccines will provide sufficient control over the disease and revert societal live back to normal. with the covid-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives around the world with no clear promises for treatment or vaccine yet, motivating the public to change their behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease becomes crucial and moral imperative. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. the novel coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic is a defining point in human history, having far-reaching effects on all aspects of human life. 
   immunity escape you talk about is not proven concerning the effect of this vaccin. Which is proved is it's his high  %age of efficiency against covid and which is certain is that covid is a mortal virus which also can cause severe after effects if you don t die. [SEP] post-exposure vaccination with vaccinia virus (vacv) has been suggested to be effective in minimizing death if administered within four days of smallpox exposure. historic observations suggest that survivors of smallpox maintained lifelong immunity and protection to subsequent infection compared to vaccinated individuals. although protective immunity by vaccination using a related virus (vaccinia virus (vacv) strains) was the key for smallpox eradication, it does not uniformly provide long term, or lifelong protective immunity (heiner et al., 1971). immunization with the voka vaccine prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children and susceptible adults. the vaccine offers close to 100% protection from severe chickenpox and 90% protection from illness. waning of immunity after vaccination, particularly in children, has not been a significant problem. vaccine virus may be less likely to establish latency and to be able to reactivate than wild type virus. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. the impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective covid-19 vaccine. 
 So what? COVID-19 is thousands of times more likely to be fatal or cause long term effects. This is a global crisis and war on a virus. People need to calibrate their thinking a little. This obsession with minute vaccine risks is dangerous and unethical. [SEP] the covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the heavy toll that emerging infectious diseases (eids) with epidemic and pandemic potential can inflict. drawing from lessons from the most recent ebola epidemic in the democratic republic of the congo, as well as the 2009 h1n1 influenza, 2014-2016 ebola, and 2015-16 zika outbreaks preceding it, we offer our perspective on challenges facing eid vaccine development and recommend additional solutions to prioritize in the near term. as covid-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. using an online platform, we surveyed the u.s. adult population in may 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the covid-19 pandemic, acceptance of a covid-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. before a covid-19 vaccine is introduced to the u.s., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective covid-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all americans, especially those who are most vulnerable. though fear is a common psychological outcome during pandemics, the covid-19 pandemic is a continuously evolving disease outbreak and has unique risk factors. the covid-19 pandemic represents a major global health crisis that continues to threaten public health and safety. in addition to putting people's lives at risk and causing mortality, various problems have occurred due to the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 has disrupted societies across the world, with a global scope that is unprecedented, ongoing, and without a demarcated end. covid-19, as an infectious disease, has shocked the world and still threatens the lives of billions of people. 
  And yes they’re included in the numbers. Covid causes inflammation in your circulatory system which can lead to things like blood clots and heart attacks. [SEP] this article reviews the roles of the contact and complement systems and of neutrophils and monocytes in the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and open heart operation. these blood proteins and cells, together with other blood elements, produce the vasoactive and cytotoxic substances and microemboli that cause the morbidity associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and open heart operation. numerous diseases are driven by chronic inflammation, placing major burdens on our health systems. c reactive protein (crp) values in blood are a good indicator of the likelihood of acute coronary and cerebral events in both healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease. cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) procedures are frequently associated with massive inflammatory responses, resulting in a high rate of morbidity and mortality in routine cardiac operations. sickle patients have high white counts and elevated levels of serum c-reactive protein (crp), cytokines, and adhesion molecules. elevated numbers of activated platelets circulate in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis and coronary disease. coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) may result in serious complications involving several organ systems, including myocardial tissue. common risk factors induce systemic inflammatory processes which lead to progression of atherosclerotic diseases as well as copd. there is increasing evidence that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder resulting from a combination of processes, and that acute exacerbations of this inflammation are associated with the acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction and unstable angina. 
From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #LongCovid  https://t.co/ydwF4NAbIW [SEP] clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system. coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. very recently, coronaviruses (cov), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 (sars-cov-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological diseases. coronaviruses (cov) are viruses widely known to cause severe respiratory distress due to the prominent clinical symptoms presented. here, we review these literatures and discuss the neurologic impact of cov while highlighting potential implications of the novel sars-cov-2 in the nervous system. among the respiratory viral pathogens, the coronaviridae family and its genera coronaviruses have been implicated as having neurotropic and neuroinvasive capabilities in human hosts. human coronaviruses (hcovs) are recognized respiratory pathogens for which accumulating evidence indicates that in vulnerable patients the infection can cause more severe pathologies. their neuropathogenicity is being increasingly recognized in humans, and the presence and persistence of human coronaviruses (hcov) in human brains have been proposed to cause long-term sequelae. virus infections of the central nervous system (cns) can manifest in various forms of inflammation, including that of the brain (encephalitis) and spinal cord (myelitis), all of which may have long-lasting deleterious consequences. similar to its predecessors, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) exhibits neurotrophic properties, which lead to progression of neurologic sequelae. 
If you’ve had COVID, your first vaccine dose may cause worse side effects. Here’s why https://t.co/NENybrfQbp [SEP] a significant portion of the u.s. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new covid-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. when we have a vaccine against covid-19, who should be vaccinated first? whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. however, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (vacv) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. vaccine hesitancy is a potential threat to global public health. human trials of formaldehyde-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (fi-rsv) vaccine in 1966-1967 caused disastrous worsening of disease and death in infants during subsequent natural respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). mortality in covid-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. since even a slight reduction in vaccination rates could produce major consequences as herd immunity is eroded, it is imperative to understand the factors that contribute to decision-making about vaccines. complacency and confidence clearly impact vaccine behavior, often more profoundly than convenience, which can contribute either negatively or positively to vaccine acceptance. 
  See this please to get the seriousness of the matter at hand. Dr Mark Gordon has a good idea of what Long Covid is and compares it to brain injury caused by explosions. This is brain inflammation and damage. Don’t work through it. Strokes, fits...etc. [NEWLINE]https://t.co/sQAcI3MnoU [SEP] the potential for misdiagnosis, the correct management and possible complications of this type of injury are discussed. it is associated with high energy trauma, and although it may present innocently enough, it is a potentially life threatening injury. low velocity traumatic dissection of the carotid artery is an infrequent but serious complication of blunt cranio-cervical injury. although it represents a rare injury the long-term complications can be fatal but mostly prevented by adequate treatment. clinically, injury severity is determined by a combination of the glasgow coma scale, length of unconsciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, and persistence of neurological sequelae. a 23-year-old man was involved in an altercation which resulted in the patient sustaining wounds to the head, with penetrating in left transorbital, affecting the eye. the aim of this review article is to draw together the more important aspects of blast ear injury for those who are unfamiliar with it and to serve as a reminder of the problems to others. it covers the interactions of blast waves with the ear giving a summary of the mechanisms and types of injury. the management of blast-related injuries is discussed. given the enormous spectrum of disease that can lead to shock it is not surprising that it is an extremely common cause of admission to the intensive care unit. 
Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt told Parliament that not one life had been lost to Covid this year.  With ZERO DEATHS as the benchmark, it's hard to defend a vaccine that's been the cause of 2 deaths in the same period. #DeathByVaccine #COVID #AZdeath https://t.co/JVdvpIMkIO [SEP] no overall protective effect against hospitalization was demonstrated, raising concerns over the durability of vaccine protection against heterotypic strains. vaccine effectiveness against rotavirus-related hospitalization was 19% (odds ratio, .81; 95% confidence interval, .32-2.05) for 2 doses compared with none. evidence was not found for an overall protective effect of human rotavirus vaccine against hospitalization for rotavirus disease in this setting. the smallpox vaccine vaccinia was successfully used to eradicate smallpox, but although very effective, it was a very reactogenic vaccine and responsible for the deaths of one or two people per million vaccinated. a safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) may be required to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic1-8. for global deployment and pandemic control, a vaccine that requires only a single immunization would be optimal. here we show the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a single dose of adenovirus serotype 26 (ad26) vector-based vaccines expressing the sars-cov-2 spike (s) protein in non-human primates. these data demonstrate robust single-shot vaccine protection against sars-cov-2 in non-human primates. the smallpox vaccine based on the vaccinia virus was successfully used to eradicate smallpox, but although very effective, it was a very reactogenic vaccine and responsible for the deaths of one to two people per million vaccinated. varicella vaccine was licensed in australia in 1999 and publicly funded in 2005. 
  So sorry for your loss. Even the J&J is way less likely to cause serious side effects than COVID. There’s a risk for sure w/any of the vaccines, but for the majority of Americans (w/o an allergy to ingredients in vaccine &no autoimmune disorders), the risk is way less than COVID. [SEP] to be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. varicella vaccine is safe, effective, and cost-effective in healthy children, adolescents, and adults. no severe adverse events have been reported following vaccination, and the incidence of herpes zoster is less in vaccinees than in individuals who have had natural varicella infections. adverse reactions to vaccines are generally mild; severe events resulting in death or permanent damage are rare. vaccine components may contribute to inflammatory, allergic or anaphylactic reactions. although there are known adverse reactions to the vaccine, the majority are relatively minor and have no long term consequences, and those that do have long term consequences are extremely rare. like other medicine, all vaccines have some side effects or complications; in general the incidence and severity of complications is lower than for pharmaceuticals. undesired side effects would not only have the potential to damage the individual infant but also lead to a loss of confidence in the respective vaccine-or vaccines in general-on a population level. most vaccine reactions are mild and circumscribed to the injection site; although in some cases severe anaphylactic reactions can be observed. 
           I believe mine was a fibro flare caused from vaccine. It’s been 13 days since vaccine & Tim’s just now getting sick. So not sure what’s going on with him. Either a stomach virus - there’s one going around or Covid cause it takes 2-4 weeks after vaccine to be fully immune. [SEP] improper vaccine storage/handling). in this article, i discuss common causes of 'vaccine failure' that are appropriately or inappropriately attributed to vaccines. analysis of the records of instances in which non-immune persons contracted yellow fever notwithstanding vaccination shows that the onset of disease occurs soon after vaccination, the longest period being 13 days. however, 14 months later, the vaccine was withdrawn from the market because of serious gastrointestinal side effects. we describe a case of vaccine-associated measles in a two-year-old patient from british columbia, canada, in october 2013, who received her first dose of measles-containing vaccine 37 days prior to onset of prodromal symptoms. identification of this delayed vaccine-associated case occurred in the context of an outbreak investigation of a measles cluster. we report the case of a child presenting with nonfebrile seizures 6 and 13 days after the first vaccination with a measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (mmrv) combination vaccine. macrophagic myofasciitis and post-hpv vaccination syndrome are two newer controversial vaccine-related disabling ailments. post-hpv vaccination syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis, and gulf war illness analogy suggests that some vaccines or multiple vaccinations in a very short period of time may induce, in susceptible individuals, chronic pain, fatigue and dyscognition. vaccine-induced autoimmune dysautonomia is hypothesized as the common pathogenetic mechanism for this symptom cluster. 
      Incorrect. Vaccine do not normally cause blood clots. Nor do viruses...SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine do.  We cannot ignore this. We can rationally protect ourselves from harm. [SEP] vaccine refusal harms and risks harming innocent bystanders. people are not entitled to harm innocents or to impose deadly risks on others, so in these cases there is nothing to be said for the right to refuse vaccination. however, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. to be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. vaccines remain one of the most effective and safest ways to tackle infections. questions have been raised recently about the possibility that particular vaccines can trigger or promote autoimmune disease, although controlled, population-based studies have not supported this notion. the current live vaccinia virus vaccine used in the prevention of smallpox is contraindicated for millions of immune-compromised individuals. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. 
  Of course it is - my own mothers lungs where so damaged by Covid it caused Covid-pneumonitis in which the lungs inflame and cause more damage, it took 2 months until her lungs barely functioning which led to her death, this was caused by Covid therefore the caused by Covid... [SEP] the present case seems to indicate that acquired cmv pneumonia in vlbw infants causes chronic respiratory failure even when mechanical ventilation is not administered, and this respiratory failure is very similar to cld in clinical symptoms and chest roentgenogram. prenatal covid infection is one of the worst affected and least attended aspects of the covid-19 disease. like other coronaviruses, cov2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development by maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus is a fast emerging disease with deadly consequences. the pulmonary system and lungs in particular are most prone to damage caused by the sars-cov-2 infection, which leaves a destructive footprint in the lung tissue, making it incapable of conducting its respiratory functions and resulting in severe acute respiratory disease and loss of life. covid-19 represents with various clinical symptoms and infects the respiratory tract, throat, nose, and lung involvement can lead to severe lung disease and death., among asthmatic patients, infections can lead to deterioration. we present an asthmatic pregnant woman who infected with sars-cov-2 admitted to two hospitals in iran. the thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe covid-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin i and inflammatory cytokines. at fi rst, covid-19 was thought to be primarily a respiratory disease, progressing in some patients to serious respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome and even death. 
 There is a round of coronavirus cold every fall and winter, so 93% of people are immune to -ncov. Immunity is achieved through lymphocytes. After 2019-ncov infection, lymphocytes were depleted. Antipyretics and corticosteroids suppress lymphocyte immunity and cause COVID-19. [SEP] the development of neutralizing antibodies (nabs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) following infection or vaccination is likely to be critical for the development of sufficient population immunity to drive cessation of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-ncov. the recent outbreak of coronavirus (covid-19) has infected around 1 560 000 individuals till 10 april 2020, which has resulted in 95 000 deaths globally. following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease (covid-19) is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. cytotoxic t-cells (ctls) and natural killer (nk) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. patients with severe covid-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. we hypothesize that patients with severe covid-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of monalizumab, interferon α, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents. covid-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in wuhan-china during the last quarter in 2019 and caused an infectious respiratory disease pandemic. a strong host immune response to the novel coronavirus is a key factor, for protection against infection and avoiding reaching severe stages of the disease. pathophysiology and the human immune response of similar coronaviruses have been previously described. 
 Oh well! This is all based on a flawed testing method that produces false positive results! Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] the ongoing global novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 outbreak has engendered numerous cases of infection and death. covid-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, currently recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates and are unable to identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. parallel testing with approved real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kits for sars-cov-2 and nts using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected covid-19 cases show that nts identifies more infected patients (22/61) as positive, while also effectively monitoring for mutated nucleic acid sequences, categorizing types of sars-cov-2, and detecting other respiratory viruses in the test sample. the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) around the world is a tragic and shocking event that demonstrates the unpreparedness of humans to develop quick diagnostic platforms for novel infectious diseases. the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a major healthcare threat. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is still ongoing. the covid-19 pandemic has been responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. the sars-cov-2 pandemic is accompanied by an ever-rising death toll attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but questions have persisted regarding deaths formally attributed to covid-19. between 23 march and 28 april 2020, a total of 162 patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr died in our nhs trust. this retrospective review of cause of death has demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of hospitalised patients with positive sars-cov-2 pcr died as a direct consequence of covid-19 infection. 
 If u have had covid u don’t need the vaccine it can cause problems by adding more antibodies to ur other antibiotics that devel in ur body from having the virus [SEP] one persistent anti-vaccine argument goes like this: getting a disease gives a person stronger or longer-lasting "natural" immunity to that illness than taking the vaccine. however there are issues with the delivery and administration of vaccines. despite the very low risk-to-benefit ratio of vaccines, fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis, and diphtheria. vaccinations are important for controlling the spread of disease, yet an increasing number of people are distrustful of vaccines, and choose not to (fully) vaccinate themselves and their children. although the vaccination-associated adverse effects commonly perceived by vaccine resisters usually represent over-reactions to rare manifestations, converging evidence shows that vaccination-associated health threats could be pervasive when systemic inflammation is considered as a side effect that oozes over time. traditional non-gastrointestinal vaccines can prevent effectively the invasion of pathogens; however, these vaccines are less effective against mucosal infections because there is not a sufficient immune response at the mucosa. however, most vaccines are unable to induce immune responses when administered mucosally, and require the use of strong adjuvant or effective delivery systems. like other drugs, vaccines can cause adverse events, but unlike conventional medicines, which are prescribed to people who are ill, vaccines are administered to healthy individuals, thus increasing the concern over adverse reactions. most side effects attributed to vaccines are mild, acute and transient; however, rare reactions such as hypersensitivity, induction of infection, and autoimmunity do occur and can be severe and even fatal. the vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy, because it contains live, attenuated viruses that pose a theoretical risk to the fetus. 
  COVID-19 causes inflammation throughout vtge body, including the brain. Inflammation has been implicated as an underlying cause for depression and is a known cause for dementia. [SEP] this paper examines the potential link between covid-19 and the presence of comorbidities and assesses the role of inflammation in this correlation. in covid-19 patients, the most frequently associated diseases share a pathogenic inflammatory basis and apparently act as a risk factor in the onset of a more severe form of the disease, particularly in adulthood. there is growing evidence that covid-19 not only affects the lungs but beyond that the endothelial system. in this regard, we hypothesized that covid-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), an acute respiratory infection, is largely associated with dysregulation and impairment of the immune system. this study investigated how the immune system changes were related to disease severity in covid-19 patients. covid-19 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, and sometimes hyperinflammatory responses with cytokine storm. this plays a major role in covid-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. in this viewpoint, we summarize the relevance of thromboinflammation in covid-19 and discuss potential mechanisms of endothelial injury as a key point for the development of lung and distant organ dysfunction, with a focus on direct viral infection and cytokine-mediated injury. covid-19 is often related to hyperinflammation that drives lung or multiorgan injury. 
So kind of a bad choice when your target for the vaccine can cause side effects in its own right.  Still this vaccine has been a huge net positive but hopefully the he next generation of covid vaccines finds something a little less harmful as the target https://t.co/Efos6smnvg [SEP] despite a continuous search for safer and more immunogenic vaccines, adverse reactions still occur. adverse reactions to vaccines are generally mild; severe events resulting in death or permanent damage are rare. based on risk-benefit studies, for an individual just as for the community, it may not always be of interest to use the vaccine with the lowest complication rate. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. for that reason, we investigated the impact of imiquimod and resiquimod (toll-like receptors agonists), and the codon-usage optimization of the vaccinia virus a27l gene in the enhancement of the immune response, with intent of producing a safe, virus-free dna vaccine coding for the a27 vaccinia virus protein. undesired side effects would not only have the potential to damage the individual infant but also lead to a loss of confidence in the respective vaccine-or vaccines in general-on a population level. individual vaccines are assumed to have no other effect than protection against the targeted pathogen, but vaccines also have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be beneficial or harmful. widespread vaccination with vaccinia virus (vacv) resulted in the eradication of smallpox; however, the licensed vacv-containing vaccines are associated with adverse events (aes), making them unsuitable for certain high-risk populations. to design peptide-based anti-polio vaccines exempt from potential cross-reactivity risks and possibly able to reduce rare potential adverse events such as the postvaccine paralytic poliomyelitis due to the tendency of the poliovirus genome to mutate. oral poliovirus vaccine (opv), because it is believed to mimic natural (wild) poliovirus infection and to induce serum and mucosal immunity, is considered ideal to interrupt virus transmission in countries with poor sanitation and endemic polio. 
 Diabetes causes blood sugar spikes. So does eating sugar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blood sugar spikes cause arterial inflammation, which increases risk for both heart disease and covid complications.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]People who ate more sugar, died sooner.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All true facts. Rationalize them as you will. [SEP] it has been proposed that simple sugar consumption is one of the major risk factors in the development of diabetes. sugar, a common constituent of diet, is also a major factor often responsible for elevating the glucose level in diabetic patients. for many, sugar represents a threat to their health, a perception that is driven by increase in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders, which directly or indirectly is connected with the consumption of sugar. hyperglycemia or high blood glucose (sugar) level is a common dangerous complication among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm). hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems if left untreated such as heart disease, stroke, vision and nerve problems. hyperglycemia forms a direct and independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular comorbidities in type 2 diabetes. consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks might further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemic episodes. heart disease and stroke are the most life-threatening consequences of diabetes mellitus, with mortality rates up to two to four times higher for persons with diabetes vs. those without and accounting for up to 65% of deaths. the incidence of diabetes has been increasing year by year. long-term growth in blood sugar causes complications such as diabetic foot ulcer and infections, which will increase the difficulty of ulcer treatment. 
The predominant symptoms of ‘long COVID’ are psychological in nature, with anxiety and depression being most common. But those of course are also exactly the conditions which have been caused in, literally, millions of people, especially young people, by the lockdowns. [SEP] living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with covid-19 related distress. multiple lines of evidence indicate that the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. studies indicate that the covid-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression and insomnia in the general population and among healthcare professionals. the covid-19 pandemic and its related containment measures-mainly physical distancing and isolation-are having detrimental consequences on the mental health of the general population worldwide. the covid-19 pandemic is leading to mental health problems due to disease experience, physical distancing, stigma and discrimination, and job losses in many of the settings hardest hit by the pandemic. health care workers, patients with covid-19 and other illnesses, children, women, youth, and the elderly are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. similar to the ebola epidemic of 2014-2016, covid-19 is expected to cause anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. the covid pandemic has had a high psychological impact on healthy populations. the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. the current global pandemic caused by covid-19 has brought about an immense effect on the mental health of the general public. 
       Not all brands of the vaccine can cause problems, there are brands that have higher lethal rates than others. The death rate of COVID is said to be 10%. It is probable that some vaccines (Maybe Johnson& Johnson) have a higher lethal rate than that [SEP] yet, given the high vaccine coverage rates in the united states, the public is increasingly becoming concerned that vaccines may be causing immediate or long-term health problems and less concerned about the possibility of becoming infected. it discusses the incidence and risks of infection, the efficacy and risks of vaccines, issues complicating the evaluation of vaccine safety, the state of vaccine safety monitoring systems, and approaches consumers use in vaccine decision making. the vaccine may establish latency and reactivate to cause herpes zoster, albeit more rarely than wild-type virus. a new smallpox vaccine candidate based on a non-replicating modified vaccinia ankara (mva) poxvirus has been assessed for cardiac safety in a large placebo-controlled clinical trial. the dearth of potential vaccines has left the survival of mankind with doubts. we have designed a novel multi-epitope, multi-protein vaccine with different proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona virus -2 (sars-cov-2) with immuno-informatics approaches, which has been validated in silico to be stable and potential. the licensed smallpox vaccine, comprised of infectious vaccinia, is no longer popular as it is associated with a variety of adverse events. in the last 10 years new concerns have arisen about safety of the live, attenuated yellow fever (yf) 17d vaccine, in particular viscerotropic adverse events, which have a case-fatality rate of 64%. knowledge about the pathogenic potential of individual strains in the varicella vaccine is limited. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. 
vaccines for COVID-19 are stopped as a matter of urgency in order to protect the public from serious harm and death.   It is also documented that Polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues relating to fertility.  9 [SEP] absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its associated impacts on health and society, covid-19 vaccines are essential. the u.s. government is working to produce and deliver safe and effective covid-19 vaccines for the entire u.s. population. the purpose of this report is to describe the four ethical principles that will assist acip in formulating recommendations for the allocation of covid-19 vaccine while supply is limited, in addition to scientific data and implementation feasibility: 1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; 2) promote justice; 3) mitigate health inequities; and 4) promote transparency. as covid-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. lack of effective antiviral agents and vaccines pose a major challenge to control this pandemic. despite the ability to dampen the spread of sars-cov-2, the causative agent of the diseases, through restrictive interventions, it is believed that only effective vaccines will provide sufficient control over the disease and revert societal live back to normal. at present, a double-digit number of efforts are devoted to the development of a vaccine against covid-19. lockdowns, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, and other strict public health measures are playing their part in delaying the spread of infection, but a safe and potent vaccine, effective therapeutics, point-of-care diagnostics, and other health products are desperately needed because it may not be practically possible for governments to extend these measures for an indefinite period of time. 
Great Article about blot clots and vaccines! Thanks for sharing!  “... and “COVID-19 is far more likely to cause blood clots than a COVID-19 vaccine” are phrases that have been repeated like mantras. That needs to continue.” https://t.co/nnUwVtZpfW [SEP] covid-19, as an infectious disease, has shocked the world and still threatens the lives of billions of people. as covid-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. using an online platform, we surveyed the u.s. adult population in may 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the covid-19 pandemic, acceptance of a covid-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. covid-19 can be associated with coagulopathy (cac, covid-19-associated coagulopathy) with a high prothrombotic risk based on an intense inflammatory response to viral infection leading to immunothrombosis through different procoagulant pathways. the debate around the role of vaccination with bacillus calmette-guérin has revived right in the time of the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic. background coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an ongoing worldwide pandemic infection. a vaccine provides the best hope for a permanent solution to controlling the pandemic. the aim of this study was to understand the attitudes towards and obstacles facing vaccination with a potential covid-19 vaccine. prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards covid-19 vaccination. messages promoting covid-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant. 
Even the New York Times is admitting:  “In rare cases, the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has led to severe and sometimes fatal blood clots. Newly published research from Germany and Norway describes a powerful immune reaction that may be the cause”. [SEP] the hepatitis b vaccine has been implicated in a few dozen cases of extraarticular, systemic, or inflammatory joint disorders. we report two cases in which hepatitis a vaccination (havrix, smith kline beecham) was followed by a connective tissue disorder or a spondylarthropathy in two healthy males aged 50 and 24 years, respectively. in modern society, a potentially serious adverse event attributed to a vaccination is likely to be snapped up by the media, particularly newspapers and television, as it appeals to the emotions of the public. the widespread news of the alleged adverse events of vaccination has helped to create the "urban myth" that vaccines cause serious neurological disorders and has boosted antivaccination associations. this claim results from controlled studies that have excluded the association between vaccines and severe neurological diseases, therefore it can be said, with little risk of error, that the association between modern vaccinations and serious neurological disorders is a true "urban myth". here we report a case of urticarial vasculitis, a rare disease in children, in probable relationship with the novel vaccine. the signal of an association between vaccination in the second year of life with a hexavalent vaccine and sudden unexpected deaths (sud) in the two days following vaccination was reported in germany in 2003. four deaths occurred within two days from vaccination with the hexavalent vaccines (rr = 1.5; 95% ci 0.6 to 4.2). we further review the principal examples of the influenza, hepatitis b, and human papilloma virus vaccines, all suspected to induce autoimmunity via molecular mimicry. the use of vaccines involves various issues, such as the possibility of side effects, which has led to fairly widespread suspicion and rejection, especially for vaccinations in the early years of life. 
  Take a look at the Epstein-Barr virus - one of the primary causes of 'glandular fever'.  We know there's a link between it and cancers, neurological disease.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid-19 seems similar but more serious in that it's highly infectious and can kill people w/o causing chronic disease. [SEP] involvement of epstein-barr virus (ebv) has long been known in the development of various tumor-forming proliferating diseases, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma in adults. however, in children and young adults more attention should be focused on systemic, severe type ebv-related diseases, such as fatal infectious mononucleosis, hemophagocytic syndrome, or chronic active ebv infection (caebv). although the relationship between human parvovirus b19 infection and rheumatic diseases has been the focus of many studies, compelling evidence that the virus is directly involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases has not yet been obtained. parvovirus b19, the causative agent of fifth disease, is one of the more serious of the common viruses. parvovirus b19 (pb19) is a common, widespread, small, single-stranded dna virus which has been linked with a broad spectrum of clinical illnesses, including a variety of neurological complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, stroke, cerebellar ataxia, and neuropathy. human parvovirus b19 (pvb19), the etiological agent of the fifth disease, is associated with a large spectrum of pathologies, among which is encephalitis. the detection of pvb19 dna in his serum and, subsequently, in his cerebrospinal fluid supports the hypothesis that this virus could potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological complications. among the range of viral pathogens involved, ebv remains a major threat because of its high prevalence of infection among the adult population and its tendency to progress to life-threatening lymphoproliferative disorders (lpds) and/or malignancy. in addition, b19v infection has been reported to trigger autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. b19v induced chronic disease and persistent infection suggests b19v can serve as a model for viral host interactions and the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. 
Similar to medications and other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. Vaccine reactions are rare. Info about side effects: https://t.co/0zWPiWE9RX  VIDEO: https://t.co/kgwjzNMEnu [SEP] immunosuppressive drugs should be withheld in psoriatic patients with the covid-19 infection. given the many medications used to treat novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) and its comorbidities and complications, the risk of drug-drug interactions (ddis) and resulting patient harm is concerning. physicians of patients with covid-19 may be interested in knowing whether opioid use disorder may affect their patients' course or prognosis. opioid use at high doses and over several months duration can mitigate the immune system's function, which may complicate the course of covid-19 disease. potential suppression of parts of the immune response may be important in prevention, clinical support, and therapeutic use of medications in various phases of the covid-19. patients taking immunosuppressants were concerned about interactions between medication and covid-19, whereas patients taking 5-aminosalicylates were not. we present two covid-19 patients treated with hcq and had adverse events. many psychiatric patients have been infected with covid-19, and patients with covid-19 may develop psychiatric symptoms after treatment with antiviral drugs. very little direct evidence exists on use of corticosteroids in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic led to significant uncertainty among physicians and patients about the safety of immunosuppressive medications used for the management of dermatologic conditions. 
   A statement that flies in the face of “Pick up your Pence” as head of the Covid Task Force. Pence is anti-science, said tobacco doesn’t cause cancer, increased HIV transmission as Governor, and Trump believes windmills cause cancer. Perdue downplayed Covid ! Vote him out! [SEP] philip morris promised to "shut down instantly"if cigarettes were found to be harmful. now that the company has admitted that "smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and other serious diseases", when will they keep their promise to stop making cigarettes? in particular, there is the argument that collective selfishness, thoughtless behaviour, and over-reaction would make the effects of covid-19 much worse. despite the surgeon general's strong track record and the rapidly expanding body of solid scientific work demonstrating that smoking caused a wide range of diseases, the decision making process for concluding "causality" in surgeon general reports has become increasingly cautious and defensive. rather than these emerging delivery devices being used to replace lethal cigarettes in what might be termed a david versus goliath strategy to disrupt the status quo, there is also legitimate concern that these new products could undermine historically successful tobacco control efforts, especially youth prevention, if allowed free reign. recently, two well-known political figures raised conspiracy theories against covid-19 vaccines in pakistan, stating that covid-19 is a grand illusion and a conspiracy against muslim countries. this theory is much discussed in the local community, supporting covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. anti-vaccine movements could undermine efforts to end the covid-19 pandemic. because pakistan is experiencing a large burden of disease, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases, immediate action is of paramount importance to eradicate any potential barriers to a future covid-19 vaccination program. one reason that tobacco-sponsored smoking cessation ads are less effective than those sponsored by public health agencies may be that the persuasive arguments in tobacco-sponsored ads are inherently weaker than arguments made in public health ads. 
   Might sound counter intuitive, but even the common cold (which are caused by corona viruses) may help our immune system recognise Covid and respond to it better.  Maybe the same happens with the flu. [SEP] coronaviruses (cov) cause common colds in humans, but are also responsible for the recent severe acute, and middle east, respiratory syndromes (sars and mers, respectively). mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (covs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. before 2003, two human covs (hcovs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. human coronaviruses are known causes of the common cold. the low pathogenic covs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness. preexisting t cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has been reported, and a recent study suggested that this immunity was due to cross-recognition of the novel coronavirus by t cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses.methodswe used the enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assay to characterize the t cell responses against peptide pools derived from the spike protein of 3 common cold coronaviruses (hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, and hcov-oc43) and sars-cov-2 in 21 healthy donors (hds) who were seronegative for sars-cov-2 and had no known exposure to the virus. t cell responses to sars-cov-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins were present in only 1 participant and were potentially the result of cross-recognition by t cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses. human coronaviruses (covs) mostly cause a common cold that is mild and self-limiting. in humans, infections with the human coronavirus (hcov) strains hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 usually result in mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. the human pathogenic coronaviruses cause infections of the respiratory tract from mild to severe ranges. 
Study: Pfizer's RNA-based covid vaccine could cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases, so its approval was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit. https://t.co/CyX9P1k9J5 https://t.co/vSTarg3dIG [SEP] human trials of formaldehyde-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (fi-rsv) vaccine in 1966-1967 caused disastrous worsening of disease and death in infants during subsequent natural respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection. these findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of vaccine-induced disease augmentation and indicate that selective chemoattraction of tregs into diseased sites may offer a novel approach to the modulation of tissue-specific inflammation. the first experimental vaccine against alzheimer's disease caused encephalitis in some patients, which led to termination of the clinical trial and dealt a serious blow to this therapeutic approach. the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is extensively impacting new and ongoing clinical trials of various medical products irrespective of indication. despite the very low risk-to-benefit ratio of vaccines, fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis, and diphtheria. part of this fear stems from the lack of public awareness of the many preclinical and clinical safety evaluations that vaccines must undergo before they are available to the general public, as well as from misperceptions of what adjuvants are or why they are used in vaccines. the focus of this review article is to open this black box and provide a conceptual framework for how vaccine safety is traditionally assessed. we discuss the strengths and shortcomings of tools that can be and are used preclinically (in animal studies), translationally (in biomarker studies with human sera or cells), statistically (for disease epidemiology), and clinically (in the design of human trials) to help ascertain the risk of the infrequent and delayed adverse events that arise in relation to adjuvanted vaccine administration. prolonged follow-up of trial participants confirmed persistent excess of all-cause pneumonia in vaccine recipients [hazard ratio (hr) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.0-2.4], but surprisingly a survival advantage favouring vaccination (hr 0.84; ci 0.7-1.0). there is risk attached to the development of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, live attenuated or otherwise, but without the acceptance of this risk by manufacturers, health providers and the public, the conclusion of successful phase iii trials may lie in the distant future. 
Expert Cardiologist ( Dr. Richard Flem­ing, physi­cist-nuclear car­di­ol­o­gist) recently issued a dire warn­ing !  Covid Vaccines Could Cause Mad Cow Disease ! ,  “I’m not anti-vax, “I’m just anti-bad medicine Flemming said”  My God ! More mad cows ! 😱🐮 https://t.co/r63fYNfii2 [SEP] the inevitable health policy question raised was whether or not to recommend against consuming beef and what public health measures should be taken. the bse case (a 10 year old dairy cow) is believed to be the result of local consumption of infected mammalian meat and bone meal more than a decade earlier. all of the lactating cows became lethargic, were inappetant, developed diarrhea, and had decreased milk production from 28 kg/cow/day, the day before exposure, to 23 kg/cow/day, 3 d later. during 2013, cutaneous lesions developed in two men in the country of georgia after they were exposed to ill cows. however, serologic evidence of exposure to an orthopoxvirus was detected in cows in the patients' herd and in captured rodents and shrews. opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against sars-cov-2, the causal agent of covid-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2-4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. sars-cov-2 had already killed more than 400,000 patients around the world according to data on 7 june 2020. the owner of a herd of 74 holstein-friesian cattle reported decreased milk production, weight loss, and coughing among lactating cows. combined with anecdotal reports of an increase in the incidence of dictyocaulosis among adult cattle in north america, d viviparus infestation should be included as a differential diagnosis for decreased milk production, weight loss, and coughing among adult dairy cattle. 
    It doesn't matter that only 14k people died of covid alone. This is completely fucking irrelevant, especially considering the fact that Covid literally causes things like pneumonia, which are included in that CDC page. [SEP] although over-all mortality among 189 patients who experienced 190 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia was 39 per cent, only 14 deaths were attributed directly to the episode of bacteremia on the basis of definitions used in this study. there were 192 cases of covid-19 and 23 deaths this fortnight, bringing the cumulative case count to 27,344 and 898 deaths. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) mortality may be underestimated because it is frequently listed as a contributory cause of death, rather then the underlying cause of death, on state death certificates. this may underestimate the true burden of disease. 15,036 mortality records from kentucky death certificates were examined for year 2000 for all deaths due to diseases most often associated with copd; notably, heart disease, pneumonia/influenza, and asthma. cases in which copd was listed as a contributory cause of death for asthma, pneumonia and influenza was small (less than 1%). this study provided evidence to generate and support the hypothesis that copd mortality is underestimated in kentucky when the underlying cause of death is heart disease, thus underestimating the true burden of disease. since the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) in 2012, the virus had caused a high case fatality rate. analysis of copd mortality based only on the underlying cause of death (ucod) derived from death certificates underestimates disease burden. in july 2013, the world health organization (who) international health regulations emergency committee determined that mers-cov did not meet criteria for a "public health emergency of international concern," but was nevertheless of "serious and great concern". 
Stay #InTheKnow about the COVIID-19 vaccine: 1 - The Pfizer & Moderna vaccines require two doses, 3–4 weeks apart;  2 - The vaccines can’t cause COVID-19;  3 - Vaccines provide protection, but won’t prevent infection. #JTCHS #WeKnow https://t.co/OQUnaWSE58 [SEP] to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its associated impacts on health and society, covid-19 vaccines are essential. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. the development of covid-19 vaccines is occurring at a rapid pace, with the potential for a vaccine to be available within 6 months. a vaccine to protect against covid-19 is urgently needed. such a vaccine should efficiently induce high-affinity neutralizing antibodies which neutralize sars-cov-2, the cause of covid-19. here, we review the anticipated characteristics of a covid-19 vaccine to avoid vaccine-associated eosinophil immunopathology. present hopes to conquer the covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. much research effort is focused on developing an effective vaccine for combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
  It's the norm for a death certificate to list >1 cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most common 'other causes' are conditions that can be CAUSED by severe Covid - e.g. pneumonia or respiratory failure, and chronic conditions such as diabetes that people can live with for years, until catching Covid. [SEP] comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in life span study subjects. the study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category "all circulatory disease" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. this study analyzes multiple-cause-of-death information from over 113,000 death certificates of canadians aged 65+ and identifies causes that are significantly likely and significantly unlikely to combine with dementia to cause death. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients often have several comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (cvds) or lung cancer (lc), which might influence resource use in the final months of life. to assess the frequency with which the cause of death on death certificates included the relevant details requested of certifying doctors, especially in deaths due to malignant disease, but also including certain other deaths where specific information would be expected to be included. consecutive series of certificates attributing death to malignancy, pneumonia, an acute cerebrovascular event, and renal failure were inspected and compared with the categories identified in the international classification of disease. death certificate inaccuracy is of major concern both in the public health domain and in individual health care, since it may yield untruthful data on the incidence, prevalence, and lethality of medical entities, and may hamper prophylactic measures among those who share, with the deceased, the common genetic, environmental, or behavioral risk factors. the prevalence of comorbidities among deaths was 83% (95% ci: 79 - 87), with heart disease and diabetes being the most prevalent. there is a high prevalence of comorbidities (83%) among patients who died from covid-19 in brazil, with heart disease being the most prevalent. 
 I really can’t believe that a steroid based treatment wasn’t already used widely in Covid19 https://t.co/FYuDGMTxwJ late dad had COPD and he was on them practically 365 days for decades ! I know covid & copd arent the same but both cause breathlessness amongst other things. [SEP] these included people across international study centres with moderate to very severe copd (gold grades ii-iv), with a mean age of 64 years.treatment with a pde4 inhibitor was associated with a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) over the trial period compared with placebo (md 45.60 ml; 95% confidence interval (ci) 39.45 to 51.75, 22 trials with 15,670 participants, moderate quality evidence due to moderate levels of heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias). chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is of increasing importance with about one in four people estimated to be diagnosed with copd during their lifetime. participants had a clinician diagnosis of copd and had either been hospitalised or taken steroids or antibiotics for copd in the previous three years; their median age was 71 years. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the most common chronic lung disease in the world, and its associated health burdens and costs are mounting. there is strong evidence, including data from randomized clinical trials, that indicates inhaled corticosteroids alone, or in combination with a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, improve patient symptoms, reduce morbidity, and perhaps even prolong survival in copd. a recent individual patient-based meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of inhaled corticosteroids in copd indicated that mortality over 3-4 yr was 27% lower in the group that received inhaled corticosteroids compared with the group that received placebo. this article reviews some of the relevant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic processes that affect mortality in copd and critically examines the effect of current copd therapies on mortality. there is no evidence that inhaled corticosteroids alone affect mortality, despite the reduction in exacerbations and increased risk of pneumonia. rather than reflexively using effective asthma therapy in the patient with copd, current and future therapy for copd is increasingly evidence based and targeted to specific inflammatory pathways that are important in patients with copd. 
Wearing a mask does cause disease, harm the immune system or create any healthy problems   https://t.co/wMCxAkV27U [SEP] for a frontline healthcare worker, wearing mask is a necessity as an important person protection equipment, it is perhaps the most-powerful psychological symbol for the general public. in this review we present the journey of face mask, originating from the first masks aimed at stopping the bad smell to its industrial use to its all-important place in the medical field. health care workers (hcw) wear masks for prolonged periods and are prone to adverse effects. protective respiratory face masks protect the nose and mouth of the wearer from vapor drops carrying viruses or other infectious pathogens. however, incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the risk of pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, an abrupt behavioural change in the form of the widespread wearing of masks has become prominent.1 wearing a mask is beneficial in lowering the risk of virus transmission. however, this measure is also known to cause various facial skin problems2, 3 , and their incidence might differ with the type of mask used. the consequences of mask-induced facial contact pressure have been extensively studied, but little is known about mask-induced breathing discomfort. with mask b, mild respiratory discomfort was reported significantly more frequently than with no mask or mask a (experiment 1: median respiratory discomfort on visual analogue scale 0.9 cm (0.5-1.4), experiment 1; experiment 2: 2 cm (1.7-2.9)). respiratory-related cortical activation was present in 1/10 subjects with no mask, 1/10 with mask a and 6/10 with mask b (significantly more frequently with mask b). 
Covid-19 can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus and dizziness https://t.co/V5itwb4NX4 [SEP] covid-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). since its recognition in december 2019, covid-19 has rapidly spread globally causing a pandemic. furthermore, covid-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has rapidly infected millions of people worldwide. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has had an immense impact on the healthcare industry. the main purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence of these neurosensory impairments in patients with covid-19, and to assess short-term recovery. olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions related to covid-19 are frequently reported and prevalent in mild symptomatic forms of the disease. the fact that covid-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. covid-19 has a wide-ranging and multimodal neurological impact. first, several neurological symptoms and complications are commonly observed in patients with covid-19. 
#covid19 a risk for a severe case is highly linked to #obesity. And #diet #nutrition #processed foods is the main cause.  #shame does not work. Listen & learn https://t.co/HcVtMGzNBQ [SEP] because obesity and its associated health problems have been largely attributed to poor self-control, laziness, and various other personal failings, society has been unwilling to assign blame to food manufacturers for their role in contributing to this problem. it has been suggested that foods with a high glycemic index are detrimental to health and that healthy people should be told to avoid these foods. lifestyle factors like unhealthy eating habits contribute significantly to high rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality among individuals with serious mental illness (smi). obesity is a major public health concern that involves an interaction between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental cues (e.g., food marketing); however, the mechanisms that link these factors and contribute to unhealthy eating are unclear. obesity represents a serious threat to health through its association with conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer. the increase in obesity and the many educational messages prompting us to eat a healthy diet have heightened people's concerns about the effects of food choice on health and weight. childhood maltreatment is consistently associated with adult obesity, leading to calls for tailored weight interventions for people with maltreatment histories. findings provide additional robust evidence that childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for obesity that may warrant tailored interventions. currently, a great number of people have an unhealthy dietary intake, leading to chronic diseases. despite the high prevalence of obesity and people being overweight, only a few strategies to promote healthier food products have been proven effective. 
   The coronavirus is related to HIV and HIV can cause seizures if there is infection in the central nervous system also sudden cardiac arrest can cause a short period of seizing. [SEP] seizures are a relatively common occurrence in patients with hiv infection. we investigated the frequency of acute seizures and epilepsy of patients in different stages of hiv infection. thirty-four patients (67%) developed epilepsy in the course of their hiv infection. seizures are a relevant neurological symptom during the course of hiv infection. new-onset seizures are frequent manifestations of central nervous system disorders in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). cerebral mass lesions, cryptococcal meningitis, and hiv-encephalopathy are common causes of seizures. the prognosis of seizure disorders in hiv-infected patients depends upon the underlying cause. seizures are not uncommon in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, and with the upsurge in hiv infection this may be an important cause for acute symptomatic seizures. opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (pml), cryptococcal meningitis and polymicrobial infections, metabolic and electrolyte disturbances, and drugs are common causes of new-onset seizures in hiv-seropositive individuals. in the absence of any cause, primary hiv infection may be considered responsible for seizures. 
  I just saw that FB won't allow anyone to see the vid I shared "Doctors Speak Out About This Powerful Covid Treatment".  "...information that could cause physical harm" Very annoying. Meanwhile I've begun IVM as prophylaxis. Feeling good about that.  Thank u Dr. Kory! [SEP] i recently diagnosed my first adolescent patient with new-onset hiv. however, there was one more thing i could have done that may have spared him this diagnosis in the first place. i could have prescribed hiv pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep). this article is meant to introduce primary care pediatricians to the idea of hiv prep. the article reviews patient eligibility, how to prescribe hiv prep, as well as drug monitoring and follow-up. she gave me the confidence to construct this ability of comforting patients into a small platform of confidence from which i could safely venture to educate patients or suggest treatments to residents. doctors must realise what impact the news can have on the patient; must overcome fear of being blamed for the message and of a sense of failure for not being able to improve the situation; and must learn how to cope with the recipient's reaction. i was very concerned, as was my patient, who was ready to terminate a wanted pregnancy for fear that she had harmed her baby. as a direct result of your advice, this "fetus" is now a happy 25-year-old mother of a healthy son. what do you think is some of the most important information you have given to practising family physicians over the past 25 years? 
Fauci's 2,000 emails a day show how little U.S. officials knew of Covid pandemic  We were played!!! This lock down, mask (oh leading cause of respiratory pneumonia), our freedom all put on hold the joke of the millennium!!!!!!! https://t.co/kiSZGQJiTx [SEP] severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic that has claimed over 700,000 human lives. the newly emerged coronavirus sars-cov-2, first reported in december 2019, has infected about five and a half million people globally and resulted in nearly 9063264 deaths until the 24th of june 2020. an innovative analysis is evaluating the nature of the covid-19 pandemic. ever since sars-cov-2 began infecting people by the end of 2019, of whom some developed severe pneumonia (about 5%), which could be fatal (case fatality ~3.5%), the extent and speed of the covid-19 outbreak has been phenomenal. sars-cov-2, the causative agent of covid-19 pandemic caught the world unawares by its sudden onset in early 2020. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the world health organization (who) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of may 4<sup>th</sup>, 2020. a novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, was first reported as a respiratory illness in december 2019 in wuhan, china. in the context of cancer patients, covid-19 has a severe impact, regarding pulmonary infection but also cancer treatments in this fragile and immunocompromised population, and icu admission for cancer patients in the context of covid-19 requires ethical and clinical consideration. we report here management of a dedicated intensive care unit of a cancer center during the covid-19 infection pandemic, considering resource allocation and redistribution of healthcare workers. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel virus responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, has infected over 3.5 million people all over the world since the first case was reported from wuhan, china 5 months ago. 
  It’s a politicised 99.98% survival rate virus. ‘Fully vaccinated’ in the states are testing positive for covid. It’s not a vaccine, it’s an experimental ( until 2025 ), mRNA gene therapy that causes autoimmune diseases and sterilisation to name a few. [SEP] in spite of dozens of clinical trials to establish effective therapeutic and/or preventive vaccine to resolve hcv infection, no real vaccine has been proved to date. genetic vaccines based on replication-defective adenoviruses have proved to elicit strong and long lasting t-cell responses against a number of viral antigens and are even currently being used for vaccine trials in humans. therapeutic cervical cancer vaccines have been extensively studied. efficacious therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of cervical cancer should be expected in the near future. the novel coronavirus disease, affecting ~9 million people in the past five months and causing >460,000 deaths worldwide, is completely new to mankind. the pandemic of hiv-1 has continued for decades, yet there remains no licensed vaccine. control animals received a vaccine encompassing no vv, or no vaccine. they exhibited reduced peak viral loads, maintenance of cd4+ t cell counts and improved survival compared to control animals that received no vv or no vaccine; there were 0/15 deaths among all animals that received vv and 5/9 deaths among controls. results define a practical means of improving vv safety, and encourage advancement of a promising multi-envelope dvp hiv-1 vaccine candidate. the outbreak of covid-19, the pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has spurred an intense search for treatments by the scientific community. 
 Severity of DAD or more chronic lung damage, clinical history. If there’s no other obvious cause of death in somebody who was admitted for covid, it’s covid. If there was something else like an MI, it’s a question of how severe systemic disease 2/2 covid/long term intubation [SEP] we investigated the predictors of 2-year mortality after patients' admission to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia, and focused on the predictive value of age. under such circumstances, the international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision (icd-10) guidelines recommend that the medical practitioner certifying the death should decide on the primary cause to be assigned. in the present article, comprehensive, easy and objective clinicopathological criteria on how to assign the single most appropriate primary cause of death or indication for a medical procedure are recommended. the autopsy data are few and the aspects often observed are pulmonary diffuse alveolar damage (dad), myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction (ami), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic); these aspects are not only in covid-19 but also in other viral infections and in sepsis. this study investigated the associations between comorbid copd with or without chf and prognosis of patients admitted to intensive care units (icu). icu patients with comorbid copd or chf both experienced greater mortalities, while these two risk factors seemed to play an independent role. logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (or) of outcome measures (acute organ dysfunction, severe sepsis, and mortality), controlling for confounding factors (age, sex, comorbidity, infection site, hospital level, and length of stay). we describe the case of a 49-year-old man with clinical features of cidp for 5 years who died of respiratory failure. the chest computed tomography (ct) imaging results were indicative of covid-19 and he was subsequently tested for sars-cov-2, which was positive. the clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of covid may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill. 
 The Covid patient “long haulers” are also very similar to some of us cancer patients. The aftermath of the disease (and for some of us C pts caused by treatment) is very similar. The brain fog, chronic fatigue, pain etc. [SEP] cancer survivorship has become a major issue due to people living longer with the effects of cancer treatment. cancer survivors are now living longer giving rise to a new concept-chronic cancer as survivors continue to face long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment. individuals with a history of cancer, often referred to as cancer survivors, may experience late and long-term effects of their treatment. survivors often experience late and long-term sequelae of cancer and its treatment (e.g., fatigue, pain, fear of recurrence, and stress). cancer-related fatigue (crf) affects a majority of patients (pts) with symptoms lasting up to several years after finishing therapy. fatigue during treatment for colorectal cancer is common, but poorly understood and can affect compliance with post-surgical cancer therapy. coping with cancer (cwc) was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite cohort study of terminally ill cancer patients (life expectancy ≤6 months) and their informal caregivers, who were followed into bereavement (n = 68). health-care-related themes described crc survivors' experiences with diagnosis, treatment decision-making, initial experiences with ostomy, and survivorship. fatigue is one of the most common complaints of people with cancer. in this report some of the crucial issues related to fatigue in people with cancer are reviewed. 
https://t.co/MUVrI0jkpX Scientists haven’t figured out  #LongCovid. Here are 5 of their best hypotheses. From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #ApresJ20 #CovidLong [SEP] following
the sars outbreak, 5 additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel coronavirus covid-19, believed to
have originated in wuhan, hubei province, china. in this review, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered covid-19 are reviewed, with a focus on
best practices and the public health implications. to date, five coronaviruses (hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, sars-cov, hcov-nl63 and hcov hku-1) that infect humans have been identified, four of which (hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku-1) circulate continuously in the human population. in this article, the current knowledge of human coronavirus hcov-nl63, with special reference to the clinical features, prevalence and seasonal incidence, and coinfection with other respiratory viruses, will be discussed. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a dangerous global threat that has no clinically approved treatment yet. a novel coronavirus, the sars-cov2, was revealed to be the cause of covid19, the pandemic disease that already provoked more than 555.324 deaths in the world (july 10, 2020). like all coronaviruses, it is characterized by its genome's high plasticity. sars-cov-2-related symptoms were fever (3 patients), persistent cough (3 patients), diarrhoea (2 patients) and syncope (2 patients); 1 patient reported no symptoms. the coronavirus pandemic has engulfed the nations of the world for the first five months of 2020 and altered the pace, fabric and nature of our lives. international members of istituto pasteur in rome and initiate, the marie curie training network reflect on the lasting global impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
 and please don't go into the hands of corona virus... it's not safe, it's injurious to your health and it's causes corona virus. [SEP] a disastrous coronavirus, which infects a normal person through droplets of infected person, has a route that is usually by mouth, eyes, nose or hands. sars-cov-2 is characterized by high virulence and contagiousness, that's why the main preventive recommendation is social distance. coronavirus disease (covid-19) is the biggest public health challenge the world is facing in recent days. coronavirus (covid-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern. this review aims to provide practical guidelines during the covid-19 quarantine period. respiratory viral infections such as coronavirus (covid-19) will cause a great mortality, especially in people who underly lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and asthma. coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 is highly infectious, which can lead to acute and chronic debilitating symptoms, as well as mortality. practical public health measures, such as social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a face mask, are the current recommended guidelines by the centers for disease control and prevention for limiting the spread of the virus. new emerging viruses like coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) infections are always frightening. the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 causes covid-19, a pandemic threatening millions. 
 You have a better chance of being hit with lightning then to get a blood clot from a vaccine. Actually Covid can cause a blood clot. [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. convalescent plasma (cp) from blood donors with anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies may benefit patients with covid-19 by providing immediate passive immunity via transfusion, or when used to manufacture hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations. administration of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. although the phase i coxiella burnetii cellular vaccine is completely efficacious in humans, adverse local and systemic reactions may develop if immune individuals are inadvertently vaccinated. the phase i chloroform-methanol residue (cmri) vaccine was developed as a potentially safer alternative. peripheral blood cells (pbcs) of vaccinees responded to c. burnetii cellular antigen in vitro in a vaccine dose-dependent manner. immunization with recombinant proteins may provide a safer alternative to live vaccinia virus for prophylaxis of poxvirus infections. although mice developed similar levels of neutralizing antibody after immunizations with a27 or l1, a27-immunized mice exhibited more severe disease upon an intranasal challenge with vaccinia virus. 
  No people are developing these diseases and dieing as a result of becoming infected with Covid 19 for example people with diabetes getting Covid and dieing of renal failure or young people getting Covid and having a stroke as it causes blood clots eg. https://t.co/AMn7OnXr15 [SEP] case series without control groups suggest that covid-19 may cause ischemic stroke, but whether covid-19 is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke than would be expected from a viral respiratory infection is uncertain. approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic. neurological complications of covid-19 have not been reported. due to pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states, covid-19 infection is believed to increase the risk of stroke and worsen the outcomes of the patients having pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases (cevd). covid-19 patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease have poor outcomes and extra precautions should be taken in managing such patients during the ongoing pandemic. coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) is a new emerging virus responsible for pandemic and death. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has affected millions of people and may disproportionately affect those with hypertension and diabetes. in conclusion, the risk of intensive care unit admission and mortality for patients with diabetes or hypertension who developed covid-19 is increased compared with those without these comorbidities. it is rare for children to be in serious condition or die from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) except for those with underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppressive disease. 
    Mask wearing as recommended by the CDC does not cause hypoxia. COVID has been clearly associated with higher risk of stroke, though no question a sedentary lifestyle as well. [SEP] a sedentary workforce may be at increased risk for future cardiovascular disease. substantial data have established a sedentary lifestyle as a major modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). sedentary behavior is associated with negative health consequences independent of physical activity levels. it is well established that a sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. lack of physical activity is associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease and mortality. despite the risks, the number of sedentary workers is increasing. the american heart association states that sedentary lifestyle is a major risk factor for cvd comparable to hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking. however, recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that sitting time has deleterious cardiovascular and metabolic effects that are independent of whether adults meet physical activity guidelines. we present a compelling selection of emerging evidence on the deleterious effects of sedentary behavior, as it is underpinned by the unique physiology of inactivity. medium sedentary time also conveyed risk (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% ci, 1.04-1.24]). 
 Covid is no joke, this is why we need the vaccine. We know that mRNA doesn't cause long term effects since it decomposes in your body within 1-2 hours. Please everyone, get vaccinated as soon as you can! [SEP] recently, self-replicating and self-limiting rna vaccines (rna replicons) have emerged as an important form of nucleic acid vaccines. the aim of this project was to transmit knowledge and convey educational messages on the importance of vaccines, through the use of games, in elementary school children, their families and teachers. a non-egg, non-culture based influenza vaccine that intervenes large influenza outbreaks and protects against heterosubtypic infections is needed. recently, self-replicating rna vaccines (rna replicons) have emerged as an effective strategy for nucleic acid vaccine development. vaccination is the most effective means for the prevention of influenza, including pandemic strains. an ideal pandemic influenza vaccine should provide effective protection with the fewest number of doses in the shortest amount of time, and among the greatest proportion of the population. undoubtedly, vaccination is one of the health interventions showing major impact on humankind. vaccines remain one of the most effective and safest ways to tackle infections. the current coronavirus pandemic is not an exception, and we all hope that ongoing international efforts will succeed in developing a vaccine soon. vaccines prevent serious infections by stimulating the immune system to identify and destroy invading organisms rapidly before they have a chance to cause disease. 
NATE BURRUANO 🇺🇸 It’s nbd that the Moderna covid vaccine includes ingredients NOT FOR HUMAN USE, which are known to cause cancer, fertility/fetal viability issues, and damage the nervous system along with your kidneys. https://t.co/jfnWR0Y2cP [SEP] nov vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials are based on noninfectious highly immunogenic virus-like particles (vlps) delivered intramuscularly (im). although the meningococcal conjugate menacwy-crm vaccine is not approved for use in pregnant women, unintentional exposure during pregnancy can occur, especially during early pregnancy among women of child-bearing age. this study provides safety information about inadvertent menacwy-crm vaccination during pregnancy. vaccines against human papillomavirus (hpv) types 6/11/16/18 (gardasil) and 16/18 (cervarix) are non-viable vaccines composed of recombinant hpv proteins. as a precaution, they should not be given during pregnancy. what are the risks for the unborn child exposed in utero to these vaccines? after in utero exposure to the hpv 6/11/16/18 vaccine during the first trimester, animal studies, only conducted in rats, showed no increase in the risk of malformations. a simple, safe, and easily deliverable vaccine may be the key for the control and prevention of nv gastroenteritis. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). vaccination with mmr in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to covid-19. 
 6 women out of +6M given. We won't know for a long time their medical history. The problem is that the disease for the vaccine can cause blood clots. So the immune reaction, in extremely rare cases, is blood clots. I still think the vaccine is better than COVID. [SEP] the use of vaccines in pregnant, immunocompromised or chronic diseases patients has been widely discussed in the literature recently. however, some candidate vaccines have been shown to protect seronegative women and transplant recipients, and we should know soon whether they can prevent congenital infection. these data suggest that this vaccine is capable of boosting immunity in a population of cmv-infected women and warrants additional evaluation to determine whether these boosted responses may prevent mother to child transmission of cmv. severe immunologically mediated reactions are rare and less common with the vaccine than the true infection. in this paper, we perform a systematic literature search and narrative review of immune-mediated vaccine adverse events and their known and proposed mechanisms, and outline directions for future research. not often realized is the intimate relationship shared between vaccines and women. women were key to the initial development of vaccines; some were even advocating the concept of protection against infectious disease through prior asymptomatic infection (by variolation) before the publication of the report of the first successful smallpox vaccination in 1798. vaccines have rewarded women handsomely in return. vaccines also have offered societal benefits to women. vaccines remain an effective yet controversial method for preventing infectious diseases like those caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) and pandemic influenza (h1n1). 
 As you can still get covid when vaccinated, it is uncertain whether the vaccine will protect against long covid. Only time will tell on this one. Even a mild case of infection can cause long covid. [SEP] however, some candidate vaccines have been shown to protect seronegative women and transplant recipients, and we should know soon whether they can prevent congenital infection. vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. lastly, in some cases, vaccination strategies may be part of the treatment paradigm in attempts to avoid complications of therapy. if a vaccine does not protect individuals completely against infection, it could still reduce infectiousness of infected vaccinated individuals to others. long term follow-up of vaccine trials is essential to establish the duration of protection. the antibody response elicited after immunization with vaccinia virus (vacv) is known to be sufficient to confer host protection against vacv or smallpox. in humans it has been shown that such anti-vacv antibody production can be sustained for decades. although long-term protection is a key-point in evaluating hpv-vaccine over time, there is currently inadequate information on the duration of hpv vaccine-induced immunity and on the mechanisms related to the activation of immune-memory. the prevention of avian colibacillosis has historically been investigated through vaccination, with variable outcomes. 
   This whole vaccine thing is nuts. This vaccine has the potential to cause huge issues whereas catching it and recovery is less of a health risk. Plus the medications that work well to fight covid but no..let’s push this vaccine mandate. Good luck to those that get it. [SEP] vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. to be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. first, there has been concern that vaccination may trigger or aggravate the disease. in fact, vaccines are the most cost-effective public health tool for disease prevention because their cost is less than the combined costs of treatment, hospitalization, and time loss from work. growing public concern about vaccine safety places additional stress on this system. this paper explores a range of vaccine financing and safety issues-and the linkages between them-and considers recent institute of medicine studies and recommendations. the development of vaccines is considered a key milestone in preventive medicine. yet, a persistent societal problem is the concern about vaccine's safety and long-term effects, and this caters to detractors of vaccination. vaccines are among the most effective measures to control and prevent infectious diseases. vaccines always will involve some risk, and risk always involves some public concern. 
The fact that we haven't found myocarditis with CMR in the hearts of asymptomatic, otherwise healthy athletes Doesn't mean that a *symptomatic* Long Covid patient cannot have myopericarditis  As seen w/ vaccine side effects in the young, just the S-protein by itself can cause it [SEP] background myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death among competitive athletes and may occur without antecedent symptoms. covid-19-associated myocarditis has been well-described, but the prevalence of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in young athletes after covid-19 infection is unknown. methods we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of collegiate varsity athletes with prior covid-19 infection, all of whom underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) prior to resumption of competitive sports in august 2020. results twenty-two collegiate athletes with prior covid-19 infection underwent cmr. conclusions our study suggests that the prevalence of myocardial inflammation or fibrosis after an asymptomatic or mild course of ambulatory covid-19 among competitive athletes is modest (9%), but would be missed by ecg, ti, and strain echocardiography. it is often reported as the result of prior silent myocarditis. these findings question whether extreme exercise during silent myocarditis may facilitate fibrosis generation and adverse remodelling. among young athletes, sudden deaths are predominantly associated with cardiomyopathies, coronary artery abnormalities and myocarditis, but coronary heart disease is a reality already in this group. myocarditis is as an important cause of sudden cardiac death (scd) among athletes. the incidence of scd ascribed to myocarditis did not change after the introduction of pre-participation screening in italy, due to the transient nature of the disease and problems in the differential diagnosis with the athlete's heart. 
  the government of #Canada was negligent and caused unprecedented damage and death. Could have been prevented!!! There must be an accounting. #COVID  https://t.co/fMzDmaGdO6 [SEP] on 10 march 2010, the ontario superior court of justice struck in its entirety percy whiteman's statement of claim against ontario and toronto for negligently failing to protect him from contracting hiv from his spouse, holding that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. whiteman's claim that canada was vicariously liable for the acts of immigration agents and employees was allowed to proceed, as it was not plain and obvious that no private law duty of care could be found to exist between whiteman and canada. canada's apparent capacity to reform its health system is inversely proportionate to the volume of high-quality reports that document its need to do so. financial strain was an issue for many canadians long before the arrival of the global novel coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. this commentary is a call to action for public health researchers and practitioners in canada to take a more prominent role in shaping the agenda on financial strain to support financial well-being for all. canada is the only universal health insurance country in the oecd without universal insurance for outpatient prescription drugs, a situation generally perceived as unfair and inefficient. the council was asked to consider three options: a universal public plan for all canadians; a public catastrophic insurance plan that would kick off once spending on prescription drugs reaches a given threshold; and a more modest patching of existing gaps, providing coverage to those who are not eligible to any form of insurance. during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the hudson's bay company served as a de facto public health agency across western canada. by the late 1830s the company was able to mount an effective vaccination campaign that covered much of western canada. on 19 april 2001, the supreme court of canada released its first judgments in litigation alleging the canadian red cross society was negligent for inadequately screening blood donors in the early 1980s. 
  They have known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem.   Why haven’t they paused those, too? https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] in december 2007, merck & co., inc. (west point, pennsylvania) announced a voluntary recall of certain lots of two haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) conjugate vaccines, pedvaxhib (monovalent hib vaccine) and comvax (hib-hepb vaccine) and suspended production of both vaccines, disrupting the u.s. supply of hib vaccine. on october 17, 2008, merck announced that restoration of the two vaccines to the market would be delayed until mid-2009. the extraordinary events surrounding the measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine in the united kingdom have not only placed in jeopardy the use of this triple vaccine but have also spread concern to other parts of the world. examination of the public's worry about mmr vaccine reveals they have been exposed to a range of conflicting views resulting in the feeling of having been misled about the safety of the vaccine. and if confidence falters, vaccine coverage dips, and an outbreak of measles, mumps, or rubella ensues, who, if anyone, will stand and say "i misled them, i confused them, this is my responsibility"? this study did not identify any new safety concerns comparing mmrv with mmr + v or after either the mmrv or the mmr + v vaccine. this study compared single-dose tetravalent measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, priorix-tetra, stored refrigerated (gsk+4c) or frozen (gsk-20c), with proquad (merck-20c), when coadministered with hepatitis a vaccine (hav) and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv7). pertussis and rotavirus vaccines have been the subject of several controversies over the years. in this paper the authors discuss facts and myths behind these controversies and also suggest solutions to overcome some limitations of these vaccines. initial rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market because of increased risk of intussusception. 
  CoVID 19 is known to create blood clotting & thickening. Your kidneys are a filter for your blood so when this happens your blood literally clogs your kidneys and causes kidney failure.  Many CoVID patients are on renal meds or dialysis. I am so sorry for your loss! This is real! [SEP] covid-19 often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by acute kidney injury (aki). covid-19 is a great threat to the modern world and significant threat to immunocompromised patients, including patients with chronic renal failure. the covid-19 pandemic has put a strain on many aspects of health care including the provision of dialysis. the rapid worldwide spread of covid-19 has posed a serious threat to patients treated with kidney replacement therapy (krt). we present the analysis of a covid-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has affected the care and outcomes of patients treated with dialysis worldwide. in this issue of kidney international, 3 reports highlight the disproportionately severe impact of covid-19 on patients on dialysis, noting its high prevalence, particularly among patients receiving in-center dialysis. patients on dialysis are at extremely high risk should they develop covid-19, with short-term mortality of 20% or higher. kidney involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is common, and can range from the presence of proteinuria and haematuria to acute kidney injury (aki) requiring renal replacement therapy (rrt; also known as kidney replacement therapy). the covid-19 and cmv coinfection in ktrs resulted in large-size kidneys with severe parenchymal echogenicity and hydronephrosis. 
  1.) They take away the most important part of our communication: mimic and body language in general. 2.) The humid, warm environment behind the masks can cause bacterial pneumonia, which in turn can lead to Corona disease. 1/2 [SEP] wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). although acceptance of such masks is increasing in the western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. face masks or respirators are commonly worn by medical professionals and patients for protection against respiratory tract infection and the spread of illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza (h1n1). in addition to its valuable protection, wearing facial mask can affect verbal communication in an adverse fashion and makes mutual understanding difficult. this happens because the mask eliminates the positive effect of the lip-reading phenomenon in direct communications. the use of surgical masks has been recommended in healthcare settings to minimize pathogen transmission between patients with cf. face masks reduce cough-generated p. aeruginosa aerosols, with the surgical mask providing enhanced comfort. since the start of the covid-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. the method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. 
 I'm not trying to make comparisons, I'm trying to point out that saying the vaccine can cause serious side effects is a bit hypocritical coming from a guy who's been trivialising covid all year when many of us have had long term illness from that. I wasn't trying to cause offence [SEP] various factors have been implicated in vaccine hesitancy and loss of vaccine confidence, but the specific ways and particular moments in which immunisation programmes and vaccine scares are politicised, exacerbating negative attitudes about vaccines and leading to retrogressive policies, have been relatively under-examined. people are not entitled to harm innocents or to impose deadly risks on others, so in these cases there is nothing to be said for the right to refuse vaccination. vaccine refusal, i argue, is morally similar to firing a weapon into the air and endangering innocent bystanders. by re-framing vaccine refusal as harmful and reckless conduct my aim is to shift the focus of the vaccine debate from non-vaccinators' religious and refusal rights to everyone else's rights against being infected with contagious illnesses. throughout the history of vaccination, vaccines have been accused of harmful side effects. however, the risk of serious events caused by existing vaccines or aluminum adjuvants is very small. although vaccines are an invaluable weapon in combatting diseases, they are often surrounded by controversy. vaccine controversies usually arise with the claims of some parents or doctors who link vaccines to harmful outcomes. these controversies often negatively affect vaccination coverage. this attitude in face of vaccines has clear consequences in the spread of diseases and their transformation in epidemics. 
Fighting stigma —  Covid-19 Impact On Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Market 2020, SWOT Analysis, New ...: Alzheimer's disease is a condition most common in people of 65 years or above age. This disease causes confusing reactions like the confusion ... https://t.co/sFZNcRossl [SEP] alzheimer's disease (ad) causes progressive loss of memory and disability, especially in older people. as the most common form of senile dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad) is accompanied by a great deal of uncertainty which can lead to fear and stigma for those identified with this devastating disease. alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive functions. as the result of predicted demographic changes over the next decades, alzheimer's disease is expected to be one of the most pressing medical and social challenges facing our generation. alzheimer's disease (ad) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain associated with memory impairment, progressive cognitive decline and changes in personality and behavior, with rising incidence among elderly people. alzheimer's disease (ad) constitutes a major socioeconomic challenge due to its disabling features and the rise in prevalence (especially among (peri)menopausal women and type 2 diabetes patients). alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide, representing a global health challenge, with a massive impact on the quality of life of alzheimer's disease patients and their relatives. alzheimer disease (ad) is the most common cause of dementia in individuals over age 65, and is expected to cause a major public health crisis as the number of older americans rapidly expands in the next three decades. alzheimer's disease (ad) is the leading cause of dementia in mid-to-late life, and is estimated to afflict approximately 20 million people worldwide. alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative devastating disorder affecting a high percentage of the population over 65 years of age and causing a relevant emotional, social, and economic burden. 
And any other virus, disease. Apparently this has been the first year with zero deaths of heart disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer. All deaths were caused by covid.🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/GIoqfeaWNR [SEP] we evaluated all human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-related deaths over the period 1 january 1995-31 december 2001 in a canadian province in which all hiv care and antiretroviral therapy are provided free of charge. the prevention of the infectious diseases was accomplished long before there was any understanding of the molecular biology of bacteria and viruses. our previous study of nonelderly adult decedents with nonnatural (accident, suicide, or homicide) cause of death (96% autopsy rate) between 1981 and 2004 revealed that the decline in subclinical coronary artery disease (cad) ended in the mid-1990s. we sought to determine whether a natural disaster affected total cardiovascular mortality and coronary mortality in an entire population. there was an average of 73 deaths per day due to ihd and ascvd during january 1 to 16, 1994; this increased to 125 on the day of the neq, and then decreased to 57 deaths per day from january 18 to 31 (p < 0.00001, before neq vs. day of neq; after neq vs. day of neq; and before neq vs. after neq). the neq was associated with an increase in deaths due to myocardial infarction and trauma but not cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or noncardiovascular causes. there have been no wild virus cases for over a decade. rabies is entirely preventable. epidemics of enterovirus 71 infection have caused the death of many children throughout the world. rhombencephalitis, brain stem encephalitis, and heart failure were present in all of the fatal cases. 
Maybe mRNA vaccines caused rare heart inflammation in some teens. "The CDC hasn’t determined if there’s really a link to the shots, and continues to urge that everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against Covid-19, which is far riskier than the vaccine." https://t.co/RH3rquGcMV [SEP] multivariable relative risk regression identified correlates of participants' willingness to get a covid-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine acceptability). the actual effectiveness of the still-to-come vaccination against the coronavirus sars-cov-2 might be challenged by vaccine hesitancy, a rather common and known phenomenon whose psychological predictors are, nevertheless, still largely debated. our study aims at understanding how adult citizens' health engagement, perceived covid-19 susceptibility and severity, and general vaccine-related attitudes affect the willingness to vaccinate against covid-19. results show that health engagement is positively related to the intention to vaccinate and that this relationship is partially mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines. when people are confronted with health proposals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, it has been suggested that fear of covid-19 can serve protective functions and ensure public health compliance. we conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect the old, provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable, even if that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable. existing literature indicated electronic cigarette users (vapers) have impaired immune response that might increase vulnerability to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection and death. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is affecting lives worldwide. in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, media reports have caused anxiety and distress in many. an exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in covid-19. 
    I've a connective tissue disease and autoimmune that both cause massive problems with teeth. W/ Covid I can't risk going to the dentist (can't afford to anyway... great health coverage, NO dental). You can only see one of the four that are broke...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fucking embarrassing. Hate it. https://t.co/HWw6HxKSdv [SEP] it is unfortunate that some of us are unable to maintain our natural teeth for our entire lives. loss may occur because of diseases we have, medicines we are taking, or the basic lack of good oral hygiene program. unfortunately, almost one-fourth of the us population has untreated dental caries, and most individuals do not seek or have access to regular dental care. untreated dental disease can cause or exacerbate chronic medical conditions, lead to unnecessary pain, and increase costs to the medical system. absence of a mandibular posterior tooth, particularly the first molar, is the basic common denominator in a wide range of dental disorders. many older americans have poor access to dental care, resulting in a high prevalence of oral health problems. the following cases of two patients with three carious, painful molars describe such a situation. dental caries is the most widespread oral disease in the world, with multifactorial aetiology. as the disease is almost completely preventable, and at its early stage well treatable, the prevalence of dental caries expresses the lack of public health literacy and skills in dental hygiene, and availability of adequate dental care. no dental patient represents a greater risk of serious illness or sudden death related to the emotional and physical stresses of dental treatment than the patient who presents for emergency or routine care with a history of heart attack (acute myocardial infarction, mi). 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/0PhwEKpCBR [SEP] background: covid-19 affects not only patients' physical health but also their mental health. for the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by covid-19. individuals with covid-19 will experience high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, and low quality of life. considering the importance of perception or representation of the disease in a state of social alert, our study intended to validate an instrument measuring the psychological process of the disease caused by the coronavirus (covid-19). crises such as the global pandemic of covid-19 (coronavirus) elicit a range of responses from individuals and societies adversely affecting physical and emotional well-being. the covid-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts on populations globally, with increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression being reported, especially in people with pre-existing medical conditions who appear to be particularly vulnerable. the aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the uk regarding the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. the covid-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. the covid-19 pandemic is a great threat to both physical and mental health as it may lead to psychological stress connected with an economic crisis, threat of unemployment, or fear of losing family members. emerging data shows that the general public may be vulnerable to the pandemic-related stress and experience frequently prevalent anxiety. 
 I received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and had side effects with a fever. That side effect is also cause to self isolate and get a Covid test as per the screening tool and Health Links.  What should people having vaccine side effects do? [SEP] nature and severity of reactions associated with the administration of measles vaccine. after immunisation with a full dose (0.5 ml) of vaccine adverse reactions were associated with a mild reaction in four children, none of whom required treatment. patients at risk of adverse reactions or suspected contraindications need specialized consultation about subsequent vaccinations. a review of cases of allergic reactions to vaccines or contraindications due to underlying diseases or sensitization to vaccine components submitted to the green channel was carried out. participants believing they had received the vaccine reported more side effects (p < .01), were less likely to report knowing someone with hiv/aids as a motivation for trial participation (p < .01), and endorsed greater concern about becoming hiv-infected as motivation for participation (p < .05). results indicate that inferences made by trial participants in vaccine trials should be identified and addressed, and that greater efforts for maintaining the blinded nature of vaccine trials and educating trial participants about the meaning of side effects are warranted. influenza vaccine is an under-utilized preventive measure, partly because of the unfounded perception that fever and myalgias frequently follow vaccination. while acetaminophen may decrease these infrequent side effects, it may also alter the immune response to vaccination. a 20-year-old man developed severe abdominal pain 1 week after being vaccinated with the first dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccine (gardasil®). despite ongoing symptoms of nausea and pain, he received the second dose of the vaccine. 
some insight, covid-19 is the name of the disease, not the virus. the virus' name is SARS-CoV 2. just like how HIV is the name of the virus that causes AIDS, and rubeola the virus that causes the measles :D [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 sars-cov-2 (covid-19) is a zoonotic virus causing a variety of severe respiratory diseases. acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. covid-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the virus associated with the coronavirus disease (covid-19) causing a pandemic worldwide in 2020. sars cov-2, the virus causing the covid-19 epidemic is distinct from, but closely resembles sars cov-1, which was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2002. the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) arises from the virus sars-cov-2 which is similar to the original sars virus. covid-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus named as sars-cov-2. recently, a novel coronavirus initially designated 2019-ncov but now termed sars-cov-2 has emerged and raised global concerns due to its virulence. sars-cov-2 is the etiological agent of "coronavirus disease 2019", abbreviated to covid-19, which despite only being identified at the very end of 2019, has now been classified as a pandemic by the world health organization (who). coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). 
  It actually is worse than the corona virus that causes the common cold. https://t.co/nlukW9crPA [SEP] the corona virus disease-2019 (covid-19) pandemic has exposed the weaknesses in the public health care delivery system, and is extremely disheartening that thousands of people are losing their lives to a single disease. the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening infectious disease, covid-19. the breakthrough of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) in wuhan, a city of china, has damaged the status of health and quality of life. coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has emerged as a fatal pandemic and has crushed even the world's best healthcare systems. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is accountable for the cause of coronavirus disease (covid-19) that causes a major threat to humanity. as the spread of the virus is probably getting out of control on every day, the epidemic is now crossing the most dreadful phase. the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov, covid-19) is historically one of the most severe acute respiratory syndromes and pandemics to affect the globe in the twenty-first century. the current worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) pandemic that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has brought some medical systems to the brink of collapse. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is highly pathogenic virus that results in coronavirus-19 disease (covid-19) a severe respiratory damaging syndrome that causes serious complications for health worldwide. covid-19 is currently a pandemic influencing several countries worldwide. 
   Lots of things can cause heart failure. Could be hereditary.  Could be stress, diet or all of the above. There is no conclusive evidence that COVID alone causes heart failure in healthy people. [SEP] cardiovascular disease is a tremendous burden on human health and results from malfunction of various networks of biological molecules in the context of environmental stress. despite strong evidence of heritability, many common forms of heart disease (heart failure in particular) have not yielded to genome-wide association studies to identify causative mutations acting via the disruption of individual molecules. in this manner, distinct-genetically encoded-chromatin environments can exhibit distinct responses to environmental stresses that cause heart failure, explaining a significant portion of the altered susceptibility that is observed in human disease. possible causes of chd include teratogenic, genetic, and random factors, or an interaction of various factors. heart failure is a heterogeneous disease, the development and pathophysiology of which involves complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. it is well known that there are several heritable forms of heart failure in which genetic variation makes an individual more likely to develop the disease; however, less is clear about the degree to which genetics plays a role in the pathogenesis of more classic forms of heart failure. this review focuses primarily on several modifier genes, principally those associated with regulation of the adrenergic and rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems and those important to vascular control in heart failure, as well as the impact of these genes in the response to treatment. coronary heart disease (chd) is one of the leading causes of death in the united states. in the majority of common cardiac diseases, even though the nature or degree of genetic influence is not understood their importance cannot be denied. although congenital heart disease (chd) is the most common survivable birth defect, the etiology of most chd remains unclear. 
   The vast majority had conditions such as respiratory failure, blood clots and stroke, which can be caused by the coronavirus itself. Others had underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, sepsis and diabetes, possibly preexisting conditions [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZOGcpcSLOe [SEP] the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus is known predominantly for its respiratory outcomes; a subset of critically ill patients demonstrates clinically remarkable hypercoagulability in which thrombotic events range from acute pulmonary embolism in patients with covid-19 pneumonia to extremity ischemia. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), apart from commonly involving the respiratory system, has its impact on the central nervous system, with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from headaches to ischemic strokes. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mainly manifests as a respiratory syndrome, besides causing other complications. severe covid-19 may also present with coagulopathy, leading to venous thrombosis and cerebral infarction. early studies suggest that acute cerebrovascular events may be common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and may be associated with a high mortality rate. the symptoms most commonly reported by patients affected by coronavirus disease (covid-19) include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. introduction while coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mostly causes respiratory illnesses, emerging evidence has shown that patients with severe covid-19 can develop complications like venous thromboembolism (vte) and arterial thrombosis as well. with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the current worldwide pandemic, there is mounting evidence that patients affected by the illness may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with thromboembolic complications including ischemic stroke. coronavirus infection outbreaks have occurred frequently in the last two decades and have led to significant mortality. despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. 
      Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Info from Mayo Clinic [SEP] the presence of covid-19 infection may increase the risk of thrombotic events including ischemic strokes. covid-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001), severe disease (nihss >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p = 0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mrs 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p = 0.001). covid-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome. some of the reported neurological manifestations of covid-19 are encephalopathy, headache, ischemic, hemorrhagic stroke, miller fisher syndrome, cranial neuropathies, and guillain-barre syndrome. covid-19 has a wide-ranging and multimodal neurological impact. first, several neurological symptoms and complications are commonly observed in patients with covid-19. neurological complications have emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. the magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic will result in substantial neurological disease, whether through direct infection (rare), para-infectious complications (less rare), or critical illness more generally (common). according to early reports, patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are at an increased risk of developing cerebrovascular events, including acute ischemic stroke (ais). covid-19 patients can develop large-scale ischemic strokes in previously healthy patients without risk factors, especially in patients who develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (sars-cov-2). 
When delhi govt solve the problem of mosquito in delhi full night we not able to sleep and it's also cause malaria pls see on this matter also either one side is corona and second side is malaria infection pls help [SEP] there are several tropical mosquito borne infections. malaria and dengue are the two common mosquito infections that are very important and cause high morbidity and mortality for many patients around the world. in this specific article, the author hereby summarizes on the topic of concurrent malaria and dengue infection. the mosquito too is not unscathed by the encounter with these parasites. because of malaria's enormous health and economic impact and the need to develop new control and eventual elimination strategies, a big research effort has been made to better understand the biology of this parasite and its interactions with its vertebrate host. with approximately 2.4 billion people at risk, plasmodium falciparum malaria infection caused by an infectious bite of an anopheles mosquito continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity, mainly in the tropics and subtropics. mosquitoes constitute a severe health problem in many areas all over the world. the mosquito is therefore a potential weak link in malaria transmission, and generating mosquito populations that are refractory to the parasite is a potential means of controlling the disease. this review considers strategies for interfering with plasmodium development in the mosquito, together with issues related to the transfer of laboratory-acquired knowledge to the field, such as minimization of transgene fitness load to the mosquito, driving genes through populations, avoiding the selection of resistant strains, and how to produce and release populations of males only. mosquito are well-known vectors that cause diseases particularly malaria and filariasis which are detrimental to human health. 
   Incidentally, the 400k Of Covid deaths are phony too!!! The fact is 1/2 of those at least were actually caused by something else (diabetes, heart diseases, etc.) as there was/still is insurance insensitives; BIG $ to code as Covid. Here’s a unique example; one month the Covid~ [SEP] more than 400,000 medicare beneficiaries had to seek other insurance arrangements when their health maintenance organization (hmo) withdrew from medicare at the end of 1998. the morbidity statistics for the united states alone would suggest that there are 400,000 victims each year who succumb to sudden coronary death, which suggests that there is a need for the development of pharmacological interventions capable of preventing ventricular fibrillation (vf) in patients identified as being at high risk. using the insurance benefit paid for the 4,300 cases, this study estimated the burden of insurance benefits spent on work-related cerebrovascular and heart disease. by considering the increase in insurance payment and average pay, the predicted insurance benefits for work-related cerebrovascular and heart disease was 107.9 billion won for the 2001 cohort and 192.4 billion won for the 2005 cohort. health insurance fraud is a potential source of expense, injustice and adverse events in medical care. we examined one type of such fraud: false claims for prescription benefits after the death of the beneficiary. of 335,536 elderly people in ontario who died between jan. 1, 1991, and jan. 1, 1997, we identified 113 for whom 1 or more prescription drug benefit claims (about 1 per 3000 deaths) were submitted more than 1 year after their death. claims for expensive medications were rare, as were those for addictive medications. our findings suggest that this type of health care fraud occurs infrequently and that countermeasures are unlikely to substantially reduce medication abuse in canada. a 1990 report prepared by the office of inspector general estimated that as much as $1 billion is lost to the medicare program annually because (i) secondary payor situations are not detected and (ii) insurance companies often do not pay when they are required to be the primary payors. 
 I want to know why long covid can get immediate recognition and treatment....an infection that can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Just like PANS and PANDAS! Yet, PANS PANDAS families are being hurled into the pits of neglect by your dangerous consensus statement [SEP] if undiagnosed and untreated, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (pandas) can suddenly and drastically disrupt the lives of previously healthy children and their families. the key to prompt diagnosis of pandas and its appropriate treatment is provider awareness that streptococcal infection may present with neuropsychiatric symptoms. the authors discuss the signs and symptoms that characterize pandas, as well as its presumed pathogenesis, and illustrate, through a composite case history, a symptom presentation, diagnostic journey, treatment course, and recovery that is representative of many pandas cases. because recognition of pancreatitis may necessitate changes in supportive care, pancreatitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of vomiting in this population. pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (pans) can be caused by infectious and noninfectious triggers. nps can help children with pans recover from their symptoms and prevent future recurrences by appropriately screening, recognizing, and diagnosing the clinical presentation of pans. pans treatment includes pharmacologic therapies as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. we need to be reaching out to patients and their families and not waiting for crises. after the outbreak of coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the world health organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current covid-19 pandemic on ocd patients. 
Some of the severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 seem to result from the activity of specific immune cells, which can cause long-term inflammation of the lungs. [SEP] covid-19 spans a wide range of symptoms, sometimes with profound immune system involvement. covid-19 is an emerging disease that can manifest itself as asymptomatic or mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals, but in some, it can progress into severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), an acute respiratory infection, is largely associated with dysregulation and impairment of the immune system. this study investigated how the immune system changes were related to disease severity in covid-19 patients. covid-19 is a clinical syndrome ranging from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia that often leads to respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. covid-19 can present with a variety of clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) depending on the host's immune responses and the extent of the associated pathologies. covid-19 may cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular alterations, and multiple organ failure, which have been ascribed to a cytokine storm, a systemic inflammatory response, and an attack by the immune system. covid-19 includes lung infection ranging from mild pneumonia to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). covid-19 is frequently accompanied by a hypercoagulable inflammatory state with microangiopathic pulmonary changes that can precede the diffuse alveolar damage characteristic of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) seen in other severe pathogenic infections. covid-19 infections are characterized by inflammation of the lungs and other organs that ranges from mild and asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal. 
  Interesting thing about Covid is that it can cause pneumonia, where as pneumonia doesn't cause Covid. [SEP] cap due to p. aeruginosa is rare and even less commonly causes necrotizing pneumonia. cryptogenic organising pneumonia (cop) is a relatively rare condition and can be difficult to differentiate from community acquired pneumonia (cap). our report highlights the value of serum procalcitonin as a biomarker in differentiating between community acquired pneumonia and cryptogenic organising pneumonia especially in the context of a high serum c-reactive protein. spontaneous pneumomediastinum unrelated to mechanical ventilation is a newly described complication of covid-19 pneumonia. we present two patients with covid-19 pneumonia complicated by spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema without positive pressure ventilation. spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a serious complication of covid-19 pneumonia, of which clinicians should be aware. the role of viral pneumonia in the cause of uip is discussed. atypical community-acquired pneumonia (cap) may be caused by zoonotic or nonpulmonary pathogens. we present a case of covid-19 pneumonia associated with spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in an immunocompetent patient with no past history of smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). we hypothesize the mechanism underlying the pneumomediastinum is the aggressive disease pathophysiology in covid-19 with an incresead risk of alveolar damage. 
Why was handcock pumping this into Covid patients![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Midazolam injection may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems such as shallow, slowed, or temporarily stopped breathing that may lead to permanent brain injury or death? [SEP] recent literary case reports indicate that bromocriptine mesylate, when used for the suppression of lactation in the puerperium, can cause serious and even lethal side effects. a greatly increased half-life in overdose due to zero-order pharmacokinetics can result in a prolonged duration of symptoms and thus prolonged hospitalization with its attendant complications. baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. oral overdosage of baclofen causes severe neurological and cardiovascular manifestations due to its gaba and dominant cholinergic effects. the known morbidity associated with intrathecal pumps includes death, infection, and sepsis including central nervous system infection, accidental overdose, wrong drug administration as well as technical failures such as pump or battery failure, catheter migration or catheter breakage. chloral hydrate is a dangerous hypnotic drug to prescribe. nowadays the effects on the circulatory system are most dangerous. its overdose can lead to life-threatening clinical symptoms, including acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. the study found statistically significant correlations between dosage of ingested baclofen and presence of acute respiratory failure, as well as duration of mechanical ventilation. there is a statistically significant correlation between the dose of ingested baclofen and the presence of acute respiratory failure, and duration of mechanical ventilation. 
Apparently COVID can cause hair loss...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So that’s cool... [SEP] hair loss is a feared side effect of chemotherapy treatment. cooling the scalp during administration of chemotherapy can prevent hair loss. with u.s. food and drug administration clearance of two scalp cooling machines, patients with cancer now have the opportunity to minimize this hair loss. heat treatment of hair may decrease concentrations of cocaine (coc) and of cocaethylene (ce) in hair and increase concentrations of benzoylecgonine (bze). the functional aspect of scalp hair is not only to protect from solar radiation and heat/cold exposure but also to contribute to one's appearance and personality. progressive hair loss has a cosmetic and social impact. a variety of factors, such as hormones, nutritional status, and exposure to radiations, environmental toxicants, and medications, may affect hair growth. other forms of hair loss include immunogenic hair loss, that is, alopecia areata. the purpose of this review is to focus on the potential of ginseng and its metabolites on the prevention of hair loss and its underlying mechanisms. proper hair care, involving hair styling and the use of mild shampoos and body-building conditioners, can amplify thinning scalp hair; however, chemical processing, including hair dyeing, permanent waving, and hair straightening, can encourage further hair loss through breakage. 
#Neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia increase the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and dying from the disease. For people with Alzheimer's the risk is three times greater. It can be six times greater if they are over 80 https://t.co/sxQ21lyfhu #science [SEP] with increased longevity and increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity, dementia is likely to raise three to fourfold. facing the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), most vulnerable individuals are seniors, especially those with comorbidities. more attention needs to been paid to the covid-19 patients with alzheimer's disease (ad), which is the top age-related neurodegenerative disease. with no known treatments or vaccine, covid-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. the age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type ii diabetes. alzheimer's disease is one of the most severe and most common chronic diseases of older persons. the incidence of alzheimer's disease and related disorders is expected to triple by 2050. there are a large number of people with primary degenerative dementia of the alzheimer type throughout the world. alzheimer's disease (ad) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain and is the commonest form of dementia. alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common cause of dementia affecting nearly 18 million people around the world and 4.5 million in the us. 
 There are studies that address that. Look up Fibromyalgia & MD in Newton, Ma. I don't go along w/his tx regimen, but he championed that, 'of course chronic illness can CAUSE depression/anxiety' & had been proven(some classic Minnesota study).Also, HCPs doubting your sick contribs [SEP] the presence of multiple lifetime psychiatric diagnoses was not intrinsically related to fibromyalgia but rather to the decision of patients to seek specialty medical care. the overlap of symptoms between cfs and depression remains a source of confusion and difficulty. but even if all cfs patients were rediagnosed as depressives, this would not negate the possibility of an underlying organic cause for the condition, in view of the growing evidence that depression itself has a physical cause and responds best to physical treatments. despite relevant evidence of physical illness promoting fibromyalgia syndrome (fms), some authors claim that it is a psychological illness, or due to "psychological amplification." the physical distress of fms can increase both anxiety and depression. there has long been a belief that depression contributes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis (ms) although supporting data are minimal at best. the goal of this study was to examine the effects of treatment for depression on fatigue in ms. sixty patients with a relapsing form of ms and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline. these findings suggest that treatment for depression is associated with reductions in the severity of fatigue symptoms, and that this relationship is due primarily to treatment related changes in mood. the aim of this review was to investigate whether components of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) or health anxiety contribute to distress, so that support and psychological therapy can be tailored better to the particular problems of people with md. evidence was found for some of the components of both ptsd and health anxiety. 
     There's a really fact based answer for that. And the covid vaccine trials started in April 2020. So it's been over a year. And mRNA vaccines can't cause autoimmune diseases (although they may be dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases.) [SEP] vaccines based on mrna coding for antigens have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in preclinical models. between oct 21, 2013, and jan 11, 2016, we enrolled and vaccinated 101 participants with 306 doses of mrna (80-640 μg) by needle-syringe (18 intradermally and 24 intramuscularly) or needle-free devices (46 intradermally and 13 intramuscularly). mrna vaccination by needle-free intradermal or intramuscular device injection induced virus neutralising antibody titres of 0·5 iu/ml or more across dose levels and schedules in 32 (71%) of 45 participants given 80 μg or 160 μg cv7201 doses intradermally and six (46%) of 13 participants given 200 μg or 400 μg cv7201 doses intramuscularly. this first-ever demonstration in human beings shows that a prophylactic mrna-based candidate vaccine can induce boostable functional antibodies against a viral antigen when administered with a needle-free device, although not when injected by a needle-syringe. human challenge trials to test the efficacy of vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2, the novel coronavirus behind covid-19, could save considerable time and many lives. dendritic cells treated with the mrna vaccine displayed enhanced antigen presentation capability. messenger rna (mrna) vaccines represent a relatively new vaccine class showing great promise for the future. this optimism is built on recently published studies demonstrating the efficacy of mrna vaccines in combatting several types of cancer and infectious pathogens where conventional vaccine platforms may fail to induce protective immune responses. this review summarizes the most important developments in mrna vaccines from the past few years and discusses the challenges and future directions for the field. the potential for development of autoimmune diseases after vaccination with new vaccines containing novel adjuvants is a theoretical concern. 
  That's not true at all. Overlooking the fact that western medicine tends to treat symptoms not causes, the Covid vaccine, like all vaccines, work by helping your body identify the virus & create antibodies to protect you from infection. Your comments do nothing but spread fear. [SEP] importantly, providing scientific information about the benefits of vaccines has not been effective in counteracting anti-vaccination beliefs. vaccines are very effective medical tools for disease prevention and life span increase. in this review, data on safety and efficacy of vaccines are discussed, showing that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks and that it is important to comply with vaccination protocols, to avoid spreading of severe, preventable diseases. those opposed to vaccinations suggest that scientific literature supporting vaccines is influenced by pharmaceutical companies. this review proves that vaccine hysteria is detrimental because: 1) it causes an increased morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases; 2) it jeopardizes research for new vaccines; 3) patients are reluctant to accept any form of immune-therapy, commonly referred to as "vaccination". results showed that the cdc's vis alone significantly increased perceptions of vaccine benefits and decreased perceived risks. prophylactic vaccination is typically utilized for the prevention of communicable diseases such as measles and influenza but, with the exception of vaccines to prevent cervical cancer, is not widely used as a means of preventing or reducing the incidence of cancer. vaccines are one of the most successful medical advances in modern times. the rotavirus vaccine minimally increases the rate of intussusception, whereas other vaccines minimally increase the risk of syncope. vaccination represents one of the most powerful medical interventions on global health. 
There are hints that pple who have serious COVID-19 mount the strongest responses, just as in the 2 other serious human diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe  SARS & MERS Both trigger high antibody levels that last up to 2 years, & T cell responses to SARS can be detected even [SEP] the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the major outbreaks to be mentioned in history in coming times. however, emerging immunological observations show hallmarks of significant immunopathological characteristics and dysfunctional immune responses in patients with covid-19. during the covid-19 pandemics of 2020, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), both adults and children were shown to mount a specific antibody response to the virus. covid-19 is an emerging outbreak similar to previous pandemics caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). the majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. we found that recovered individuals developed sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory b and t cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. these findings demonstrate that mild covid-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity. the majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. we found that recovered individuals developed sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory b and t cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. these findings demonstrate that mild covid-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity. 
 You literally missed the point of everything I said. Mild infections will not cause long term lung damage. That’s it. Infections, viral or otherwise, causing vasculitis and thrombosis, is nothing new. Only thing new is greater % of severe infections with Covid19. [SEP] all individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (covs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. the disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is usually mild and self-limiting in previously healthy children, but they may also develop severe disease. several published studies have shown an association between covid-19 illness and secondary bacterial infection. the aim of this commentary is to update the current evidence of the risk of bacterial infection in patients with covid-19. we present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with covid-19.communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma. complications are generally mild and rarely severe, and virtually every individual is infected by adulthood. infection is associated, however, with a high risk of serious complications in certain high-risk groups, such as leukemic children. it is rare for children to be in serious condition or die from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) except for those with underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppressive disease. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is known to be associated with a heightened risk of thromboembolism. however, the risk associated with mild and moderate illness from covid-19 is unknown, and there is no current recommendation for prophylaxis against thromboembolism in patients after hospital treatment, unless there are established thrombophilic risk factors. 
The ignorant and misinformed people on this thread!! Let’s tell our 18 year olds not to get a vaccine because of side effects, leaving them open to getting a disease which can potentially cause long Covid and problems for months after! Great parenting there!! 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/6FR5dTPFOg [SEP] misinformation about vaccines confuses parents who may delay or refuse vaccines for their children, which places them and others at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. since some parents are unaware of the diseases and potential health threats, many are often influenced by the media and myths, choosing to delay or avoid vaccinations. vaccine-preventable diseases, popular myths, and evidence-based research findings are reviewed in this manuscript. a growing number of parents delay vaccinations or are deciding not to vaccinate their children altogether. parents who choose not to vaccinate their children despite having been informed about the evidence on safety and efficacy of vaccines may seriously jeopardise the health of both their own children and others. vaccinations are important for controlling the spread of disease, yet an increasing number of people are distrustful of vaccines, and choose not to (fully) vaccinate themselves and their children. parents who refuse to vaccinate their children implicitly call into question an intervention that most pediatricians see as one of the safest and most effective health care interventions of all time. controversies regarding vaccine components and side effects have misled parents to believe that vaccines might be harmful based on inaccurate data from the internet, celebrities, as well as misinterpreted and frankly bad science. this article intends to review some of the common vaccine myths and controversies and to serve as a resource to provide accurate information and references for busy practitioners and the families that we serve. this paper argues that, even if a parent chooses to not vaccinate a child under a state law permitting exemptions, that decision does not create complete protection against liability for the adverse consequences of that choice. 
We may see a flood of patients with memory loss or even #Alzheimers in a few years; #COVID19 can cause major problems in the brain that look similar to #TBI or #Alzheimers disease.  https://t.co/fhtlPKk9yg [SEP] the covid-19 epidemic is affecting almost all individuals worldwide, and patients with alzheimer's disease (ad) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (mci) are particularly at risk due to their characteristics and age. this study aims to analyse the case fatality of covid-19 in a cohort of patients with degenerative dementia. our results suggest that case fatality of covid-19 is significantly higher among patients with primary degenerative dementia than in other patients with similar mean ages and comorbidities. neurological complications have emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 is also anticipated to take a toll on the nervous system in the long term. patients with covid-19 have a fairly high risk of neurologic complications, including encephalopathy, stroke, central nervous system infection, seizures, and neuromuscular diseases. we have provided an overview on the profound impact of covid-19 upon older people with alzheimer's disease and other dementias and the challenges encountered in our management of dementia in different health-care settings, including hospital, out-patient, care homes, and the community during the covid-19 pandemic. more attention needs to been paid to the covid-19 patients with alzheimer's disease (ad), which is the top age-related neurodegenerative disease. covid-19 patients have presented with a wide range of neurological disorders, among which stroke is the most devastating. with the increase in the number of cases worldwide, neurological symptoms and psychological illnesses from covid-19 have increasingly upsurged. 
‘Covid infection can cause liver damage’ https://t.co/bbxcfViujg [SEP] interaction between these viruses generally amplifies liver damage, increasing the risk of developing end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. liver injury can result from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection with more than one-third of covid-19 patients exhibiting elevated liver enzymes. microvesicular steatosis, inflammation, vascular congestion, and thrombosis in the liver have been described in autopsy samples from covid-19 patients. several factors, including direct cytopathic effect of the virus, immune-mediated collateral damage, or an exacerbation of preexisting liver disease may contribute to liver pathology in covid-19. due to its immunological functions, the liver is an organ likely to participate in the viral response against sars-cov-2 and this may predispose it to injury. a better understanding of the mechanism contributing to liver injury is needed to develop and implement early measures to prevent serious liver damage in patients suffering from covid-19. this review summarizes current reports of sars-cov-2 with an emphasis on how direct infection and subsequent severe inflammatory response may contribute to liver injury in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. hcv infection is characterized by a systemic oxidative stress that is most likely caused by a combination of chronic inflammation, iron overload, liver damage, and proteins encoded by hcv. chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) causes chronic liver injury and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). liver cancer, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver are the outcomes of chronic infection with hcv. 
#EU #covid #brexit  disagreements re covid vaccines could cause more damage within the Eu than brexit did [SEP] what are the risks for the unborn child exposed in utero to these vaccines? there are more, relatively reassuring, data on the hpv 6/11/16/18 vaccine. this paper explores the potential impact of prophylactic versus reactive vaccination strategies of hcws in preventing early epidemic transmissions. a prophylactic vaccination campaign for front-line hcws is not a trivial undertaking; whether to prioritise long-lasting vaccines and provide prophylaxis to hcws is a live policy question. prophylactic vaccination is likely to have a greater impact on the mitigation of future epidemics than reactive strategies and, in some cases, might prevent them. this has implications both for policy and for the optimum product profile for vaccines currently in development. the possibility of new vaccinia immunizations in the event of a bioterror-related smallpox release poses an additional negative impact on the utility of vaccinia-based vectors. hepatitis e is an emerging zoonotic infection of increasing public health threat for the uk, especially for immunosuppressed individuals. we describe what happened in the eu and what might change in the near future from an economic perspective. hpv vaccination is now established in most eu countries. 
Yo, why would a vaccine that creates spike proteins smooth muscle contractions cause the kidney to start releasing large amounts of blood clotting compounds in susceptible people? Must be the adenovirus. https://t.co/AvxlcaEDFv  oh https://t.co/A1S4YrLGcP https://t.co/rq8kOxTWhP [SEP] despite the success of the adenovirus vaccine administered to us military trainees, acute respiratory disease (ard) surveillance still detected breakthrough infections (respiratory illnesses associated with the adenovirus serotypes specifically targeted by the vaccine). adenovirus is an important cause of haemorrhagic cystitis in kidney transplant recipients. human adenoviruses (hadvs) cause acute respiratory, ocular, and gastroenteric diseases and are also frequently used as gene and vaccine delivery vectors. the results of the phase iib study of the adenovirus serotype 5-based merck trivalent hiv vaccine have raised the concern that serological immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 (ad5) could be linked to hiv acquisition risk in high-risk individuals. we examined the association between adenovirus serostatus and the rate of incident hiv infection in populations at elevated risk of hiv acquisition. here we demonstrate that plasma, saliva, and tear fluid promote binding and infection of adenovirus type 5 (ad5) in respiratory and ocular epithelial cells, which corresponds to the natural tropism of most adenoviruses, and that plasma promotes infection by ad31. we conclude that the use of coagulation factors by adenoviruses may be of importance not only for the liver tropism seen when administering adenovirus vectors to the circulation but also during primary infections by wild-type viruses of their natural target cell types. realization of the potential clinical utility of recombinant adenovirus for gene therapy or vaccine development depends on a better understanding of the role of naturally occurring or therapy-induced anti-adenovirus antibodies. an adenovirus-based (ad-based) vaccine delivering antigens from the alphavirus venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (veev) is a strategy that offers clinical potential. however, it was noted that antibody responses directed against the adenovirus vaccine vector were increased, which may be detrimental, particularly in the context of homologous boosting. 
Based on few articles, that comparison is incorrect, because covid causes clots in the brain (Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: CVST), while birth control pills cause clots in the legs that travel to the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism) & those are treatable with anticoagulants. [SEP] cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt), also known as cortical venous, cerebral sinus, cerebral venous sinus, or dural sinus thrombosis, is an infrequent grave condition affecting pregnant females, resulting from clot formation in one of the many outflow tracts of the brain. there was no significant difference in the blood loss at delivery between the placenta praevia with cvs and those without (925 vs 870 mls p = 0.3877). rarely, consumptive coagulopathy is reported to coexist with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. pregnancy is a well-known state of hypercoagubality, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism (vte). cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt) is a rare complication of hypercoagulable states such as pregnancy, lupus anticoagulant syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, malignancies, and the use of oral contraceptive pills. in this review, we compare the efficacy and safety profile of traditional anticoagulants heparin and vitamin k antagonists (warfarin) to novel oral anticoagulants, which include rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran. the advantages of the new anticoagulants are their effectiveness, short half-life, oral intake instead of parenteral, and the decreased need for constantly monitoring prothrombin time (pt), activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), and the international normalized ratio (inr). in this review, we discuss studies that demonstrate that these novel oral anticoagulants are effective and safe in treating cerebral venous thrombosis without many adverse effects when compared with traditional treatment options. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is a rare and potentially deadly condition. anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for cvst. 
 Yeah. & I don’t think they don’t have a Covid vaccine for babies yet so I definitely wouldn’t put it in my body while pregnant. Cause you really don’t even know they effect it’s gonna have on you either. I got mine the other day tho. No side effects except for a sore arm. [SEP] in the absence of circulating smallpox, pregnant women should not be exposed to live vaccinia virus contained in the smallpox vaccine. the smallpox vaccine should not be administered to women who are pregnant or might become pregnant within 4 weeks after vaccination because of the risk for fetal vaccinia, a rare but serious infection of the fetus. to prevent inadvertent exposure of pregnant women to vaccinia virus, screening for pregnancy is a component of pre-event smallpox vaccination programs. immunisation during pregnancy is a relatively new strategy, and is currently limited to tetanus, pertussis, and influenza vaccines. none of these vaccines were developed specifically for use in pregnancy, but they provide an effective method of protecting mothers and young infants. the administration of vaccines is not usually recommended in pregnant women because of a fear of severe adverse events for the fetus. administration of a vaccine to a pregnant woman is not a routine event and it is generally preferred to administer vaccines either prior to conception or in the postpartum period. if pregnant woman is exposed to these vaccines or if pregnancy occurs soon after vaccination, the women should be counselled regarding the risks to the fetus and vaccination should not be a reason to consider termination of pregnancy. further research in vaccination among pregnancy is warranted for the safety of the pregnant women and their newborn for a healthy living and better life. we investigated the adverse reactions of pregnant women who received the influenza a (h1n1) 2009 virus vaccination and also conditions of neonates of the vaccinated women. 
   Sorry but I’m slapping this down really hard. Too much mis info out there as it is. Covid-19 vaccine does NOT cause shingles. It is caused by leftover measles viruses in your body. It’s a very small possibility getting the Covid-19 vaccine can trigger the shingles. [SEP] the covid-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) and has spread worldwide, with millions of cases and more than 1 million deaths to date. here, we generated measles virus (mev)-based vaccine candidates expressing the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein (s). these results are highly encouraging and support further development of mev-based covid-19 vaccines. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). mortality in covid-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. vaccination with mmr in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to covid-19. despite the use of measles vaccine, measles virus continues to circulate and cause severe disease. measles is a highly infectious viral illness and is one of the world's most contagious diseases that can affect all people if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before. since early january 2017, a new outbreak of measles in italy has been observed. vaccination against measles is safe, effective, and cost-effective. 
   The cytokines released in severe COVID can cross the BBB & cause inflammation. The “happy hypoxia” has neuro implications. The cytokine storm can also cause clots. Again, the mechanism of cell entry is identical to SARS 1. And I can’t find any info that SARS 1 did this. [SEP] certain evidence shows that the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the strong upregulation of cytokine production in sars-co-v2 induced pneumonia with an associated cytokine storm syndrome. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), at the origin of the worldwide covid-19 pandemic, is characterized by a dramatic cytokine storm in some critical patients with covid-19. critically ill covid-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm are believed to have a worse prognosis and increased fatality rate. in sars-cov-2 infected patients, cytokine storm appears important to the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of covid-19: acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic diseases such as acute ischemic strokes caused by large vessel occlusion and myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis (kawasaki-like syndrome in children and renal vasculitis in adult). sars-cov-2 affects part of the innate immune response and activates an inflammatory cascade stimulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, particularly within the lung. covid-19 generates a complex systemic inflammatory response that can lead to death due to wide macrophage activation, endothelial damage, and coagulation in critically ill patients. sars-cov-2 causes a delay in the innate immune response and it disarranges the immune system leading to an overwhelming inflammatory reaction (the 'cytokine storm'). in this scenario, high levels of interleukins (il), notably il-6 and il-1, create a positive feedback of chemokines and immune responses, and powers pulmonary and systemic tissue damage, leading to capillary leakage and sars, the main cause of death in patients with covid-19. the sars-cov2 infection triggers a multisystem inflammatory disorder, knowing as covid-19, a pandemic disease. covid-19 can provoke an acute inflammatory process and uncontrolled oxidative stress, which predisposes one to respiratory syndrome, and in the worst case, death. 
 Same with me and my siblings, but in our case it's long term illnesseses that cause compromised immune systems, in fact my brother is on immune suppressants due to a rare auto immune disease, so for us the risks of COVID are far worse than potential side effects of the vaccine. [SEP] currently, vaccinations with live vaccines are regarded as contraindicated under immunosuppressive therapy, mainly because of concerns about side effects and a lack of data showing an adequate immune reaction. infection with the measles virus is thought to be associated with a transient but profound period of immune suppression. overall, while the immune impacts of measles may be strong and clearly evident at the individual level, their epidemiological signature in these data appears both modest and inconsistent. measles is a highly contagious viral disease that remains the leading vaccine-preventable cause of child mortality worldwide. deaths from measles are due largely to an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections, attributed to a prolonged state of immune suppression. vaccine-preventable diseases (vpd) are a significant risk to paediatric solid organ transplant (sot) recipients on lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. younger patients with covid-19 may experience an exaggerated immune response to sars-cov-2 infection and develop cytokine release syndrome (crs), which may be life threatening. we present a case of life-threatening crs caused by covid-19 infection with a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy with tocilizumab (tcz). cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in covid-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.immunosuppressive therapy may provide important additional therapeutic benefit in these patients.tocilizumab, a specific il-6 inhibitor, led to dramatic clinical improvement in a young patient with severe covid-19-associated cytokine release syndrome. since covid-19 in the pediatric population is infrequently severe, the indirect costs of the pandemic, related to the measures implemented to deal with the spread of the virus, can be worse than the infection itself. 
   A mortality rate under 1% from a vaccine is still a stunning success. Of course people may die from it, but those cases are far and few between and a much lesser toll than untreated covid will cause. The scales aren’t even close to equal. [SEP] vaccines represent the most successful medical intervention in history, with billions of lives saved. this review provides a rational perspective on the possible development of future single-dose vaccines. experience with one-dose varicella vaccination of children in the usa has shown that with high immunization coverage a marked decline in morbidity and mortality occurs. breakthrough disease cannot always be prevented, but two-dose vaccination offers significantly better protection than a single dose. the benefits of immunization greatly exceed the risks because of the large number of complications and deaths prevented. although, the risks of vaccine-associated adverse events are extremely low, the occurrence of such events in areas with high immunization coverage levels and low incidence of vaccine preventable diseases can influence public acceptance of immunization services. not only are vaccines potentially the least expensive mechanism to combat infectious diseases, under optimal conditions, widespread vaccination can result in disease eradication - as in the case of smallpox. vaccination is the intervention with the potential to save the most lives when a pandemic occurs. the incredible success of vaccinations in contributing to public health is undeniable. in fact, vaccines are the most cost-effective public health tool for disease prevention because their cost is less than the combined costs of treatment, hospitalization, and time loss from work. 
 Thanks for linking this and telling some of your story. 💜 I've dealt with chronic illness most of my adult life. My biggest worry about COVID-19, and not just for myself, is the long-term effects it's going to cause. Few people understand how drastically it can change your life. [SEP] among the far-reaching impacts of covid-19 is its impact on care systems, the social and other systems that we rely on to maintain and provide care for those with "illness." the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic continues to be a devastating chapter in history. as we pen these words, the covid-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on human society. the covid-19 pandemic is leading to mental health problems due to disease experience, physical distancing, stigma and discrimination, and job losses in many of the settings hardest hit by the pandemic. similar to the ebola epidemic of 2014-2016, covid-19 is expected to cause anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. the covid-19 pandemic has been a source of worry for many, but older adults have been identified as more vulnerable to serious cases and may therefore feel more concerned about the virus. we assessed whether covid-19 worry was related to indicators of mental health and preparedness for future care, in an adult lifespan sample. with the advent of the covid-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the greatest global challenge in a generation. with the advent of the covid-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the greatest global challenge in a generation. with no known treatments or vaccine, covid-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. 
The virus seems to cause two kinds of lung disease + blood disease. Young people are having strokes. Young people who had light cases may be developing new syndromes of dangerous illness. #COVID is the Swiss army knife of viruses, can & will do anything to anybody. https://t.co/Nj7UA6jvma [SEP] with the virus becoming more prevalent day by day, it is not just the elderly, but even young people are falling seriously ill. indeed, neurological sequelae of sars-cov-2 infection have already been reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus (cov) from a translational perspective. the current covid-19 pandemic has recently brought to attention the myriad of neuro- logic sequelae associated with coronavirus infection including the predilection for stroke, particularly in young patients. covid-19 is a pandemic viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus, sars-cov2, which is a global concern of the twenty-first century for its rapid spreading in a short period. this article reviews the neurological manifestations, the proposed neuroinvasive mechanisms, and the potential neurological sequelae of sars-cov2. covid-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by the widespread transmission of the coronavirus sars-cov-2. some of those infected become seriously ill. others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to transmission of the virus. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has amazed by its distinct forms of presentation and severity. covid-19 patients can develop large-scale ischemic strokes in previously healthy patients without risk factors, especially in patients who develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (sars-cov-2). neurological complications are common in patients with covid-19. 
 There are are over 1000 Covid cases in East Lansing.  The virus can cause cardiac inflammation. Anyone else think this is just a really stupid idea? [SEP] in the united states, the annual incidence of myocarditis is estimated at 1 to 10 per 100,000 population. viral myocarditis (vmc) is a disease characterized as myocardial parenchyma or interstitium inflammation caused by virus infection, especially coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) infection, which has no accurate non-invasive examination for diagnosis and specific drugs for treatment. we have previously shown that ctls play conflicting roles in coxsackievirus b (cvb) myocarditis; they assist in controlling virus replication, but also are instrumental in causing the extensive inflammatory disease, which often results in severe myocardial scarring. however, this notion is changing as other viruses such as parvovirus b19 and human herpesvirus-6 are increasingly reported as causes of myocarditis in the united states, with the most recent example being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing the coronavirus disease-19. viral myocarditis is a life-threatening illness that may lead to heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias. this study examined whether human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hipsc-cms) could be used to model the pathogenic processes of coxsackievirus-induced viral myocarditis and to screen antiviral therapeutics for efficacy. myocarditis is well known to be caused by viral infections such as coxsackie virus group b, human herpes virus 6 and parvovirus b19. however, during the current emerging outbreak of sars-cov-2, there have been few case reports describing myocarditis as a possible presentation. in our case report we describe, early cardiac manifestations of sars-cov-2 in a uk district general hospital. viral myocarditis (vmc) is a type of inflammation affecting myocardial cells caused by viral infection and has been an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) worldwide. 
    No, with a virus that causes heart, lung, kidney & brain damage, strokes & heart failure are known to be caused by #COVID19.  It’s also expected to cause more cases of dementia long term. Now go get a vaccine! https://t.co/Egd4G45E0Q [SEP] the year 2020 will be punctuated by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the history of human civilization. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) will continue to have a significant impact on the way we live for at least the next few years until the scale-up of production and administration of an effective vaccine. background: as of august 11, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has infected 19,936,210 persons and led to 732,499 deaths worldwide. the current covid-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. the virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after covid-19. coronavirus (covid-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern. respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, covid-19, has been labeled a pandemic by the world health organization. respiratory viral infections such as coronavirus (covid-19) will cause a great mortality, especially in people who underly lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and asthma. currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus disease, named covid-19, has become a great global public health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. 
 They are both are Coronaviruses that are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections. Rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak can be lethal. [SEP] coronavirus is a group of viruses which causes diseases in mammals and birds. in humans they mainly cause respiratory tract infections, with a large spectrum of severity, from mild, self-limited infections to highly lethal forms as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in humans as well as in animals. in humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). among the human coronaviruses, highly pathogenic ones are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) which have been implicated in severe respiratory syndrome in humans. the emergence of deadly human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) have bolstered research in these viral and often zoonotic pathogens. the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003 and, more recently, middle-east respiratory syndrome (mers) has demonstrated the lethality of covs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. coronaviruses (covs) are causing a number of human and animal diseases because of their zoonotic nature such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a newly emerging respiratory virus and is causing covid-19 with high morbidity and considerable mortality. coronaviruses are a family of enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses causing respiratory, enteric, and neurologic diseases in mammals and fowl. 
    If you get vaccinated you can fight of infection as if you get normal cold. As your immune already knows the threat the effect of virus will be mild. In case you dont get vaccine..your immune takes time to identify virus(covid turns to pneumonia fast) which may cause serious prob [SEP] however, influenza vaccination often confers protection from disease but not from infection. despite the presence of replicating virus, single tiv vaccination prevented induction of pro-inflammatory cyto- and chemokines, alveolar macrophage depletion as well as the establishment of lung-resident b and t cells after infection. these results suggest that suboptimal vaccination with conventional influenza vaccines may still positively modulate disease outcome after influenza virus infection, while promoting humoral heterosubtypic immunity after virus infection. the best way to prevent infection is vaccination against influenza. we also discuss immunity of influenza infection in connection to pathogenesis of autoimmune response and autoimmune disease. we briefly examine the induction and benefits of virus-induced immunity. the most effective method for the prevention of influenza infection would be prophylaxis with a safe and effective vaccine and anti-viral materials. one of the most effective outbreak containment methods is vaccination. a safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. the prevention of viral infection by vaccination relies on stimulating an appropriate immune response in order to reduce the probability with which a virus can establish an infection. 
 Covid19 contains 4 spike proteins found in hiv. The cause of Covid 19 is from the twins that were genetically altered to be immune to hiv.  They contracted a coronavirus that exploited their resistance to hiv, and mutated to covid19 [SEP] the covid19 infection is caused by the sars-cov-2 virus, a novel member of the coronavirus (cov) family. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) prevalence has caused many problems in society and disrupted many regular aspects of life. covid-19 contains major structural proteins that among them, s protein can promote fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and facilitate the entry of coronavirus into the host cells. new coronavirus sars-cov-2 is capable to infect humans and cause a novel disease covid-19. covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus and is currently a global pandemic. the recent release of covid-19 spike glycoprotein allows detailed analysis of the structural features that are required for stabilizing the infective form of its quaternary assembly. ligands of covid-19 spike glycoprotein that we have predicted in the present computational investigation, might be the basis for new experimental studies in vitro and in vivo. a novel human coronavirus sars-cov-2 (also referred to as cov-19) that emerged in late 2019 causes covid-19 disease a respiratory tract infection which provokes about 4 million deaths per year. while individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) manifested a broad range in susceptibility and severity to the disease, the pre-existing immune memory to related pathogens cross-reactive against sars-cov-2 can influence the disease outcome in covid-19. there is considerable variation in disease behavior among patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
Peripheral neuropathy hurts, I know firsthand via a motor-sensory stroke.  The CoVID vaccine DOES cause the fingers to ache -- my weakest finger aches now; it was the thumb a week ago.  But it's NOTHING like the CPSP pain, at all!   It's a sore pain (how I notice the difference). [SEP] we suggest, the brachial plexus inflammation was a distal extension of a dorsal ganglionitis. we demonstrate the motor neuropathy is an inflammatory demyelinative process consistent with the recovery observed in a number of patients. we postulate post-herpetic neuralgia may be related to an ongoing inflammatory process. a 64-year-old lady noticed weakness of her thumb within two weeks of having developed "shingles" causing vesicular lesions on her arm and hand. symptoms of chronic compressive peripheral neuropathy consist predominantly of an achy feeling, paresthesias, numbness, and a sense of weakness or fatigue, with the onset being insidious and frequently without a precipitating cause. in rare cases, lesion of the central nervous system may result in syndromes suggesting peripheral nerve damage by the initial examination. injections into the palmar hand for trigger finger, palmar flexor tenosynovitis, and dupuytren contracture can be very painful. forty-seven corticosteroid injections for trigger fingers in 19 individuals were randomized to (1) anesthesia consisting of median and ulnar nerve block with 1% lidocaine anesthesia followed by standard injection or (2) standard injection alone using the 1-needle 2-syringe technique consisting of transthecal dilation of the synovial sheath with 0.5 ml 1% lidocaine with a mechanical syringe, the reciprocating procedure device, followed by injection with 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide. baseline pain, needle insertion/sheath dilation pain, corticosteroid injection pain, resolution of trigger finger, and pain at outcome (2 weeks) were determined. standard injection for trigger finger was associated with significant pain in 100% of subjects. 
Fighting stigma —  COVID-19 'brain fog' inspires search for causes and treatments: Spudich leads a study using brain imaging along with analyses of spinal ... off Alzheimer's disease and other conditions without adequate evidence. https://t.co/CXW5PMcTav [SEP] this review investigates the relationship among sivd severity, cognitive status and neuroimaging markers. subcortical ischemic vascular disease (sivd) is a common, but often overlooked cause of vascular cognitive impairment. cerebral small vessel disease (csvd) is a highly prevalent condition associated with diffuse ischemic damage and cognitive dysfunction particularly in executive function and attention. functional brain imaging studies can reveal mechanisms of cognitive impairment in csvd, although findings are mixed. cerebral small vessel disease (csvd) is a widespread condition associated to stroke, dementia and depression. to shed light on its opaque pathophysiology, we conducted a neuroimaging study aiming to assess the location of csvd-induced damage in the human brain network. in conclusion, mri findings of csvd are associated with widespread impairment of structural brain network connectivity, which supports the understanding of csvd as a global brain disease. cognitive impairment caused by subcortical ischemic vascular disease (sivd) has been elucidated by many neuroimaging studies. in the present study, 20 subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment no dementia patients (sivcind) and 20 dementia patients (sivad) were enrolled; additionally, 19 normal controls were recruited. in this paper, we provide an overview of the conceptual and methodological obstacles that undermine efforts to link the severity of specific symptoms to specific neurobiological measures. 
             Misunderstanding of nicotine is profoundly bad.  A recent Rutgers U. study found 80% of US doctors think it causes cancer.  It does not.  Nicotine MAY reduce #COVID19 risks; DEFINITELY reduces Parkinson's disease risk 30-60%; MAY reduce Alzheimer's; DEFINITELY reduces weight... [SEP] many people overestimate the health risks associated with nicotine, mistakenly perceiving nicotine as the main carcinogen in cigarettes and a leading cause of smoking-related diseases. however, a lower risk perception of nicotine could also lower perceived risk of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). the nicotine message lowered people's perception of nicotine harm but it did not change attitude and intention toward tobacco product use. previous research has shown that a substantial proportion of smokers believe that nicotine causes serious diseases such as cancer, possibly deterring the use of nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) for smoking cessation or smoking reduction. however, belief that long-term nicotine replacement therapy use can cause health harm does not appear to act as a deterrent to using it in a quit attempt or for smoking reduction. however, the safety of nrt is controversial because numerous preclinical studies have shown that nicotine enhances tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. in a transgenic model of mutant k-ras-driven lung cancer, nicotine did not increase tumor number or size and did not affect overall survival. likewise, in a syngeneic model using lung cancer cell lines derived from nnk-treated mice, oral nicotine did not enhance tumor growth or metastasis. these data show that nicotine does not enhance lung tumorigenesis when given to achieve levels comparable with those of nrt, suggesting that nicotine has a dose threshold, below which it has no appreciable effect. nicotine, an important component of tobacco, is a major risk factor of lung cancer, but the mechanism through which nicotine promotes lung cancer development remains unclear. 
 The FDA has known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem. Why haven’t they paused those, too?  https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] we assessed the association between the pdufa deadlines and the timing of fda drug approval by constructing dynamic cox proportional-hazards models of review times for all new molecular entities approved between 1950 and 2005. as compared with drugs approved at other times, drugs approved in the 2 months before their pdufa deadlines were more likely to be withdrawn for safety reasons (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.3 to 27.8), more likely to carry a subsequent black-box warning (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% ci, 1.2 to 20.5), and more likely to have one or more dosage forms voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% ci, 1.5 to 7.5). the food and drug administration licensed a live-virus varicella vaccine (varivax; merck & co inc, west point, pa) in march 1995. prelicensure adverse events were minimal; however, since licensure and increased vaccine use, rare previously undetected risks have arisen. the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), co-managed by cdc and the food and drug administration (fda), is the national postmarketing safety monitoring system that accepts reports about adverse events that occur after administration of u.s.-licensed vaccines (1,2). the established safety profile of the fluoroquinolones has been disrupted in the past decade by the detection of low-frequency but potentially serious adverse events that have led to the license suspension, voluntary withdrawal, or restricted use of specific members of the class. however, vaccines are pharmaceutical products that carry risks so that many adverse events (aes) are reported after receiving vaccines. the 14,543 spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions received in eudravigilance from 1 november 2009 to 30 april 2010 for three centrally authorized influenza a/h1n1 vaccines marketed in the european economic area (celvapan, focetria and pandemrix) were extracted to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations to strengthen pharmacovigilance systems during the pandemic and illustrate methods of signal detection used by the european medicines agency in this context. a few advances stand out, mainly involving recent drugs, but on the whole, the situation is worrisome in terms of medication safety. although pharmaceutical companies and drug regulatory agencies seem to be taking more account of the risk of accidental poisoning in children, the level of protection remains low overall in the absence of stringent measures on the part of the authorities. 
  Steady on.  Covid (particularly the new strain) does cause pneumonia... [SEP] the vast majority of patients in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic primarily present with severe respiratory illness. background coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, and is associated with severe respiratory disease. as coronavirus pandemic continues to spread over the world, physicians have to be aware of atypical features of covid-19 pneumonia. we report the case of a 78-year-old man presenting with pseudo-tumoral focal lesion of the left lung which switched shortly to severe and diffuse covid-19 induced pneumonia. we hypothesize that this receptor might be an ideal candidate to target in covid-19-associated severe pneumonia. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has been established as a cause of severe alveolar damage and pneumonia in patients with advanced coronavirus disease (covid-19). during the pandemic of a new coronavirus infection one of the most serious complications is pneumonia. we present a series of 3 cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with covid-19 pneumonia. in our literature review we discuss several plausible mechanisms and risk factors resulting in a pneumothorax with covid-19. pneumothorax is one of the reported complications in covid-19 and clinician vigilance is required during assessment of patients, as both share the common symptom of breathlessness and therefore can mimic each other. 
   So basically we never have to wear sunblock again because UV rays kill the virus. Of course those same rays can cause skin cancer, but at least no Corona right? SMH Don't forget to drink some bleach tonight.  gets my vote [SEP] while protecting oneself from ultraviolet radiation (uvr) can largely reduce risk, rates of unprotected sun exposure remain high. sunless tanning (self-tanners and spray tans), a method of achieving the suntanned look without uvr exposure, might be an effective supplement to prevention interventions. this cluster randomized trial will examine whether a beach-based intervention that promotes sunless tanning as a substitute for sunbathing and includes sun damage imaging and sun safety recommendations is superior to a questionnaire only control group in reducing sunbathing frequency. secondary outcomes include frequency of sunburns, use of sunless tanning products, and sun protection behavior. ultraviolet radiation is the most important carcinogenic agent related to the development of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer, and primary prevention efforts focus on reducing exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet sunlamps. ultraviolet radiation (uvr) in sunlight has deleterious effects on skin, while behavioural changes have resulted in people gaining more sun exposure. past studies conducted with unfiltered sunlamps emitting nonsolar spectrum uv power (wavelengths below 295 nm) or using excessive uv doses have suggested sunscreens may not prevent uv-induced immunosuppression in mice. sunscreens are ultraviolet radiation (uvr)-absorbing chemicals that attenuate the amount and nature of uvr reaching viable cells in the skin. the near epidemic of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer in the united states and certain other industrialized nations is attributable to cutaneous exposure to sunlight more than to any other factor. chronic exposure to uv irradiation and a high total cumulative dose may be less deleterious than are periodic bursts of large amounts of sun exposure leading to severe sunburn. 
Diet, exercise, and other interventions, you can radically reduce your risk of COVID-19. The focus of my COVID-19 prevention method is on strengthening immune function through stress and anxiety reduction. Chronic stress cause inflammation which has a profound impact on diseases [SEP] workplace interventions that focus on modifying lifestyle habits may reduce cvd risk factors in people at risk. covid-19 is an alarming public health concern worldwide. this article presents an exercise prescription that can be followed in the days of the covid-19 pandemic. the review intended to examine the interaction between the changes in the immune system during aging and the development of a covid-19 infection, focusing on pathophysiological factors, and to evaluate whether regular physical activity can strengthen the immune system in older adults. during the covid-19 pandemic, older people can stay active and healthy through playing sports such as yoga, walking, jogging, and cycling. in general, due to the positive role of regular exercise training on the immune system of the older adults as well as the involvement of the immune system in covid-19, it's necessary to guide and implement home-based exercises for older adults. given the psychosocial effects of the covid-19 pandemic process and the vulnerability of individuals with mental illness, it is clear that some preventive measures will increase the well-being of these individuals and reduce relapses. careful planning and execution of preventive measures to be taken at the individual, institutional, and social level are essential to minimize the negative consequences of this pandemic for this vulnerable population. the success of behavioral interventions and policies designed to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic depends on how well individuals are informed about both the consequences of infection and the steps that should be taken to reduce the impact of the disease. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) poses a serious global health threat. 
 It's just so ignorant and stupid to insist the covid-19 vaccine will cause people to be  magnetic.  It's just so ridiculous It's pitiful. [SEP] this article draws on a broadcast popular among the anti-vaccine community to map out six themes used by the broadcast to mislead viewers about covid-19. the article points out that similar themes are used to mislead followers with anti-vaccine information. it highlights the concern that these themes will not only mislead people who are already anti-vaccine about the pandemic, but may draw in people who are not anti-vaccine but are seeking information about covid-19, and suggests some options for dealing with the misinformation. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). vaccination with mmr in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to covid-19. opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against sars-cov-2, the causal agent of covid-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2-4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. vaccine-hesitant parents are often portrayed as misinformed dilettantes clinging to unscientific internet chatter and a debunked study that linked the mmr vaccine and autism. vaccinations are important for controlling the spread of disease, yet an increasing number of people are distrustful of vaccines, and choose not to (fully) vaccinate themselves and their children. research suggests that it may be difficult to change vaccine-related attitudes, and there is currently no good evidence to recommend any particular intervention strategy. 
There’s no evidence that the new #vaccine against COVID-19 cause infertility, yet that’s a worry that’s been cited by some has a reason they’re reluctant to be first in line to get the shots. #covid #infertility https://t.co/NlB1y0WWWw [SEP] when we have a vaccine against covid-19, who should be vaccinated first? covid-19 is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic, and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available. vaccine refusal has an impact on public health, and the human pappillomavirus (hpv) vaccine is particularly underutilized. present hopes to conquer the covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. given the continuing covid-19 pandemic and much of the u.s. implementing social distancing owing to the lack of alternatives, there has been a push to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing. much research effort is focused on developing an effective vaccine for combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). our results point at a concerning level of covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in turkey, and suggest that wider communication of the scientific consensus on the origin of the novel coronavirus with the public may help future campaigns targeting covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. when people are confronted with health proposals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, it has been suggested that fear of covid-19 can serve protective functions and ensure public health compliance. in the current era of the covid-19 pandemic, the world has never been more interested in the process of vaccine development. with communities having felt the burden of prolonged isolation, finding a safe and efficacious vaccine will yield direct beneficial effects on protecting against covid-19 morbidity and mortality and help relieve the psychological and economic load on communities living with covid-19. 
     a person who had high blood pressure or diabetes out it is still the Covid19 that killed them. They would be contributing caused not the primary one.[NEWLINE]And yes, if a person had  Covid but  had a diabetic coma and died you would likely say that the diabetic coma was the primary [SEP] hypertension, diabetes and heart disease are the most common comorbidities in patients with covid-19. there is a high prevalence of comorbidities (83%) among patients who died from covid-19 in brazil, with heart disease being the most prevalent. cardiovascular disease (cvd) is the most common co-morbidity associated with covid-19 and the fatality rate in covid-19 patients with cvd is higher compared to other comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. introduction: prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients with vascular risk factors, and certain comorbidities is worse. we evaluated if the presence of cnd in covid-19 patients is a predictor of a higher in-hospital mortality. presence of cnd was an independent predictor of death (hr 2.129, 95% ci: 1.382-3.280) but not a severer covid-19 disease (or: 1.75, 95% ci: 0.970-3.158). conclusions: the presence of cnd is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized covid-19 patients. therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe covid-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin i and inflammatory cytokines. our results suggest that case fatality of covid-19 is significantly higher among patients with primary degenerative dementia than in other patients with similar mean ages and comorbidities. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients with cardiac injury have an increased risk of mortality. 
   No.  The Mrna vaccines don't use the live virus that causes covid-19.  The astrazeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus as a delivery system.  This  "vector" virus does not cause covid - 19. [SEP] human adenoviral vectors are being developed for use in candidate vaccines for hiv-1 and other pathogens. the adenovirus type 5 (ad5)-based vaccine developed by merck failed to either prevent hiv-1 infection or suppress viral load in subsequently infected subjects in the step human phase 2b efficacy trial. the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) lacks most of the known vaccinia virus (vacv) virulence and immune evasion genes. vaccines against human papillomavirus (hpv) types 6/11/16/18 (gardasil) and 16/18 (cervarix) are non-viable vaccines composed of recombinant hpv proteins. smallpox vaccine based on live, replicating vaccinia virus (vacv) is associated with several potentially serious and deadly complications. consequently, a new generation of vaccine based on non-replicating modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) has been under clinical development. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). vaccination with mmr in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to covid-19. modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) is an attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (vv) that has attracted significant attention as a candidate viral vector vaccine for immunization against infectious diseases and treatment of malignancies. the recent failure of subunit vaccines suggest that presentation of more antigens via a live attenuated vaccine may be required for protection. 
DO NOT RECEIVE SATAN'S VACCINES[NEWLINE]VACCINES FORBIDDEN by THE CREATOR[NEWLINE]VACCINES do NOT PREVENT Covid19 infection or transmission of the virus.[NEWLINE]VACCINES cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects. [NEWLINE]VACCINES contain harmful ingredients. [NEWLINE]VACCINES MADE FOR PROFIT not MEDICAL REASONS https://t.co/qTFslcm7MY [SEP] the novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is the cause of covid-19, which has had a devastating international impact. test results of a complete viral pathogen panel and covid-19 testing were abstracted. covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. healthcare workers (hcws) reporting no history of varicella frequently receive varicella vaccination (voka) if they test varicella-zoster virus (vzv) immunoglobulin g (igg) negative. a total of 110 hcws received two doses of voka vaccine spaced 6 weeks apart and sera collected pre-vaccination (n = 100), at 6 weeks post-completion of vaccination (n = 86) and at 12-18 months follow-up (n = 73) were analysed. mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. this article draws on a broadcast popular among the anti-vaccine community to map out six themes used by the broadcast to mislead viewers about covid-19. the article points out that similar themes are used to mislead followers with anti-vaccine information. it highlights the concern that these themes will not only mislead people who are already anti-vaccine about the pandemic, but may draw in people who are not anti-vaccine but are seeking information about covid-19, and suggests some options for dealing with the misinformation. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. 
There is something I don't get - why does an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer's cause breathing problems?  Those with COVID-19 have such problems presumably because the virus is attacking the lungs. But the mRNA vaccines don't contain any viruses. [SEP] respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, covid-19, has been labeled a pandemic by the world health organization. there is no vaccine currently approved for paramyxovirus-induced respiratory diseases in humans, despite their major clinical importance. we review the development and evaluation of new vaccine strategies based on live-attenuated chimeric and recombinant vaccines against human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 3, which are significant causes of upper and lower tract respiratory diseases. respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children worldwide, and no vaccine is currently available. notably, instead of affording protection, a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine induced severe respiratory disease including deaths in vaccinated children in a 1960s clinical trial; however, recent studies indicate that other forms of experimental vaccines can also induce pulmonary pathology in pre-clinical studies. enhanced respiratory disease associated with inactivated rsv vaccine involves a complex network of host responses, resulting in significant pulmonary lesions and clinical manifestations such as tachypnea and airway obstruction. it has been hypothesized that tobacco smoking history may increase severity of this disease in the patients once infected by the underlying coronavirus sars-cov-2 because smoking and covid-19 both cause lung damage. current study was designed to focus on smoking history in patients with covid-19 and test this hypothesis that tobacco smoking history increases risk for severe covid-19 by damaging the lungs. influenza vaccination is an important strategy in the prevention of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). patients with copd should be reassured that the influenza vaccination is safe and does not cause an increase in exacerbations. 
 Typical example where covid19 is not a flu threat, but rather attacks the brain and causes major brain dysfunction. [SEP] the current covid-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. albeit primarily a disease of respiratory tract, the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (covid-19) has been found to have causal association with a plethora of neurological and neuropsychological effects. however, the pathogenesis of covid-19-induced neurological manifestations is still in its infancy. covid-19 is the emerging health emergency ruining the well being of individuals and devastating the global economies. background: the covid-19 pandemic has been causing varying severities of illness. encephalopathy is a major neurological complication of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but has not been fully defined yet. severe covid-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. systematic early eeg detection of encephalopathy related to severe covid-19 is important for the acute care and the management of long-term neurological and cognitive sequelae, and may help our better understanding of its pathophysiology. the covid-19 pandemic has evolved into arguably the largest global public health crisis in recent history-especially in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or an effective anti-viral treatment. the novel coronavirus infection (covid-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. 
   If the vaccine hasn't been around that long, how do they know it can cause Alzheimer's. It doesn't suddenly come in a rush! 🤦‍♀️ I do know people who've had Covid - they had a worse reaction to the AZ vaccine but only 24-48 hours. Covid symptoms were awful and more than a month. [SEP] early commercially available pandemic h1n1 vaccines did not contain adjuvant, as did many of the subsequent vaccines, and could not stop infection with the pandemic virus in vaccinated ferrets. this article reviews data from extensive worldwide experience with the refrigerator-stable version of the vaccine, including information derived from its use in over 10,000 individuals participating in clinical trials investigating its immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness, and safety, as well as postmarketing data including its use in universal mass vaccination programs. the recent h1n1 influenza pandemic illustrated the shortcomings of the vaccine manufacturing process. the a/california/07/2009 h1n1 pandemic influenza vaccine or a(h1n1)pdm09 was available late and in short supply as a result of delays in production caused by low yields and poor antigen stability. part of this fear stems from the lack of public awareness of the many preclinical and clinical safety evaluations that vaccines must undergo before they are available to the general public, as well as from misperceptions of what adjuvants are or why they are used in vaccines. although symptoms are commonly reported following vaccinations, their causes are not always straightforward. however, the anti-influenza human vaccine failed to show the required efficacy both in infants under 5 years old and in the elder population, who are among those with the highest risk of developing severe complications after influenza infection. gk-1, a novel 18-aa peptide adjuvant, has been proved to increase the immunogenicity of the human influenza vaccine in both young and aged mice. scientists and health officials are concerned that an h5n1 influenza pandemic could be both imminent and catastrophic. human trials of formaldehyde-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (fi-rsv) vaccine in 1966-1967 caused disastrous worsening of disease and death in infants during subsequent natural respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection. 
    As far as being run over by a truck, yes it is possible that someone trying to beat a truck when crossing a road collapses and gets struck down.  Cause lungs collapsed from damage caused by Covid, totally possible. Cardiac  arrest is one of many symptoms of covid. [SEP] a 49-year-old male pedestrian was fatally injured when an overloaded truck backed over him and two of the truck's rear wheels rolled over his chest. the analysis suggests that loading by either the case weight or the maximum-permitted weight of the vehicle would have caused very severe compressions of the chest, likely resulting in multiple rib fractures, collapse of the ribcage and injury to the thoracic organs. thus, this analysis suggests that severe, possibly life-threatening, thoracic injury would have occurred if the vehicle was loaded to its maximum-permitted weight. the results from initial crash tests suggest that occupants of cars that collide with the unguarded sides of trailers are at a high risk of serious injury to the head, neck, and chest due the large intrusion of the roof and roof support structures into the occupant compartment. motor vehicle accidents account for most cardiac ruptures, but crush injury is relatively rare. cardiac contusion is usually caused by blunt chest trauma and therefore is frequently suspected in patients involved in car or motorcycle accidents. our objective is to present a case of fatal acute occlusion of the right coronary artery after blunt thoracic trauma due to vehicle accident and conduct a brief review of the current literature. a 58-year-old sustained chest trauma after a vehicle accident, complicated by acute occlusion of the right coronary artery. this fatality is generally seen in pedestrians run over by trains and also in motorcyclists who impact against the tailboard of trucks. we present a case of decapitation with complete degloving injury of the neck in a patient involved in a traffic accident, and we briefly discuss the possible mechanisms producing this injury. 
 Precisely. It’s what I’ve said. Me being a young adult COVID does not affect me that much. A common flu is more severe for me, this vaccine we don’t know the long term health risks. The first vaccine caused blood clots, Who know what else these new one can cause [SEP] our modeling shows that universal vaccines that provide short-term protection are likely to result in small frequent epidemics, whereas universal vaccines that provide long-term protection are likely to result in severe infrequent epidemics. simultaneous administration of intra-nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (livac) and ivac reduces the infection rate and thus illness rate amongst high-risk elderly. our study aims at understanding how adult citizens' health engagement, perceived covid-19 susceptibility and severity, and general vaccine-related attitudes affect the willingness to vaccinate against covid-19. i show that there is no good evidence that vaccines reduce serious complications of influenza, the outcomes the policy is meant to address. in addition, there are potential vaccine-related harms, as unexpected and serious adverse effects of influenza vaccines have occurred. a significant portion of the u.s. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new covid-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. it may take time to obtain a vaccine for the current covid-19, and the virus genome may keep an evolution and mutations, so a universal and effective vaccine for the coronavirus may not be possible. epidemiological studies reveal the infection of sars and covid-19 in children is less frequent and less severe than in adults. childhood vaccine-mediated cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation might provide protection against the infections of covid-19. this manuscript describes the safety of instituto butantan (ib) seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (tiv) from 2013 to 2017. 
  ...so a vaccine trialed in a study from the early 2000s can cause a liver inflammatory response in ferrets. But so can Covid-19, along with inflammation of most major organ systems. [SEP] previous vaccine reports have noted robust neutralizing antibody and inflammatory responses in ferrets, resulting in enhanced hepatitis. we evaluated the humoral immune response and pathological end points in ferrets challenged with the urbani strain of sars-associated coronavirus (sars-cov) after having received formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccine or mock vaccine. humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine. histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets. sars-cov infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue, as seen previously in infected mice. the vaccine provided mild immune protection to the ferrets after challenge; however, there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole-virus vaccine. the ferret may provide another useful model for evaluating sars vaccine safety and efficacy. these animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against covid-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. the results of this study suggest that virulent field isolates and fpv s have immunosuppressive effects when inoculated into young chickens, which appeared in the first 3 weeks post infection. the potential problems and ominous signs include (1) lung injury that developed in animals given an experimental vaccine for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov)-1; (2) a perversion of adaptive immune responses called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection that occurs in sars-cov-1 and that may occur in people vaccinated for covid-19; (3) the frequent and recurrent infections that are caused by respiratory coronaviruses; and (4) the appearance of mutations in sars-cov-2 proteins, which raise the specter of vaccine escape mutants. 
      An interesting arcticle (German language, pls use a translator), why Ivermectin and in first step, an antibiotic, isn't the correct choice in case of a new infection, before the first symptoms occure, or just occured.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/OythDvIzBP[NEWLINE]Corona causes an endotheliitis. [SEP] the rapid and reliable diagnosis of melioidosis is required for an adequate onset of therapy. selection of appropriate antibiotic treatment for children with acute otitis media (aom) is challenging. only 2 are reliably effective against penicillin-resistant pneumococcus: high dose amoxicillin (80 to 100 mg/kg/day) and im ceftriaxone. recognition of the fundamental determinants of effective therapy should permit rational antibiotic selection for each patient. these reactions most often occur after initiation of therapy, but can also develop before treatment. erythromycin is frequently prescribed in germany for acute otitis media, but well-designed clinical trials under present epidemiological conditions are lacking. therefore, a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial was performed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of erythromycin estolate versus amoxicillin in children with acute otitis media and to identify the risk factors associated with clinical failure. treatment-related adverse events were recorded in eight (5.3%) of 151 erythromycin-treated patients and in 11 (7.3%) of 151 amoxicillin-treated patients. in this study in an outpatient setting in germany, erythromycin estolate was as safe and effective as amoxicillin in the treatment of acute otitis media. the primary endpoint is the difference between intervention and control groups regarding the antibiotic prescribing rate before and after the intervention assessed through routine data. 
#COVID19 IS NOT A COLD Soooo If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, understand that this can happen: “#coronavirus could be acting like herpes, which causes cold sores & in rare cases, brain swelling AKA #encephalitis. That swelling triggers the immune system.“ https://t.co/dw3WQZCbmr [SEP] the world is experiencing a pandemic of coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by type-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2). a new coronavirus disease called covid-19 has been considered to be a public health emergency of international apprehension by the who. this new disease includes multiple symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. due to its high degree of contagiousness and like almost no other virus, sars-cov-2 has put the health of the world population on alert. covid-19 can provoke an acute inflammatory process and uncontrolled oxidative stress, which predisposes one to respiratory syndrome, and in the worst case, death. the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has previously never been identified with humans, thereby creating devastation in public health. might covid-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) breakthrough infections? in contrast to denv, sars and mers covs predominantly infect respiratory epithelium, not macrophages. an acute respiratory disorder (covid-19) that accelerated across the globe has been found to be caused by a novel strain of coronaviruses (sars-cov-2). the coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has become a pandemic. 
 An organization that doesn't use statistics to guide policy is inept. 6 vaccine injuries out of 7 million doses administered. One in a million odds. Versus what are the odds of injury from covid? Less than one in a million? An over abundance of caution can cause harm. [SEP] general physicians, pediatricians and parents realize that serious adverse events occur with an extremely rare incidence, but have no information on the incidences of vaccine-associated adverse events. a proper understanding of vaccine adverse events would be helpful in promoting an immunization strategy. the total estimated incidence of serious neurological illness after vaccination was 0.1-0.2 per million immunization practices. these providers may have less experience administering vaccines and thus less confidence or self-efficacy in doing so. the population-level safety benefits of the acellular pertussis vaccine may have been underestimated because only specific adverse events were considered, not overall impact on health services utilization. however, these events can cause public fearfulness and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccination. the psychology of risk perception puts the emotive evaluation of the risks associated with vaccination incorrectly into a high risk category. all vaccines cause some adverse events; serious adverse events are rare. like other medicine, all vaccines have some side effects or complications; in general the incidence and severity of complications is lower than for pharmaceuticals. when considered on a population basis, the incidence of serious complications of vaccination is minute, when compared with the outcome of natural infection. 
   It looks like covid causes neurological damage hence the array of symptoms. So supplements like B12 and magnesium may help. Also histamine seems to be high in some long haulers so reducing this can have benefit, by avoiding high histamine foods [SEP] we believe that the onset of clinical symptoms such as migraine and convulsions is preceded by a period in which damage is expressed exclusively by subclinical electroencephalic abnormalities; persisting damage to neuronal tissue subsequently leads to clinical manifestations. we previously demonstrated disturbances in the metabolism of ingested histamine in patients with chronic urticaria (cu) and proposed that this could be related to increased intestinal permeability to histamine. we examined duodenal biopsies from seven patients with cu before and after intraduodenal administration of histamine (120 mg). prevents motion sickness. some biomedical evidence supports this contention in that b12 influences the metabolism of histidine and choline; dietary precursors to neurotransmitters with established roles in motion sickness. susceptibility to motion sickness was evaluated after b12 (1000 micrograms, i.m.). the experimental motion stressor was a modified coriolis sickness susceptibility test. following two baseline tests with this motion stressor, subjects received a b12 injection, a second injection two weeks later, and a final motion sickness test three weeks later. the possibility that patients with b12 deficiencies are more susceptible to motion sickness cannot be ruled out. two-hundred and thirty-six hospitalised acutely ill older patients, who were part of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, were assigned to receive daily mixed oral nutritional supplements containing b-group vitamins or a placebo for 6 weeks. 
  Doesn't matter. Covid can cause existing comorbidities to worsen. Covid can also CAUSE comorbidities, such as pneumonia, heart attack, clotting, kidney disease, etc. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/v4dkIEeqXH [SEP] comorbidities are neither causes nor consequences of cirrhosis, but they can increase mortality and are therefore clinically important. comorbidity is associated with worse health outcomes, more complex clinical management, and increased health care costs. existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are inconsistent and insufficient. the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of covid-19. in patients with severe/fatal covid-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidities were obesity (42%, 95% ci 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95% ci 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95% ci 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95% ci 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95% ci 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95% ci 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% ci 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95% ci 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95% ci 1-3%). in order of the prediction, the pooled ors of the comorbidities in patients with severe or fatal covid-19 when compared to patients with non-severe/fatal covid-19 were as follows: chronic respiratory disease, or 3.56 (95% ci 2.87-4.41); hypertension, or 3.17 (95% ci 2.46-4.08); cardiovascular disease, or 3.13 (95% ci 2.65-3.70); kidney disease, or 3.02 (95% ci 2.23-4.08); cerebrovascular disease, or 2.74 (95% ci 1.59-4.74); malignancy, or 2.73 (95% ci 1.73-4.21); diabetes, or 2.63 (95% ci 2.08-3.33); and obesity, or 1.72 (95% ci 1.04-2.85). chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy are clinical risk factors for a severe or fatal outcome associated with covid-19, with obesity being the most prevalent and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting patients with comorbidities. moreover, a higher mean cci score also significantly associated with mortality and disease severity. comorbidities might increase the risk for less favourable outcomes, but it has been reported that patients with antecedents of asthma or allergic diseases were under-represented among hospitalized covid-19 patients. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect.   https://t.co/aTtdgb6xWf [SEP] the association of smell and taste loss with covid-19 has been well demonstrated with high prevalence rates. us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of covid-19. covid-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). loss of smell and taste are common complaints in patients with the covid-19 disease. loss of taste and smell were common symptomatology of covid-19 disease. it is reported that coronavirus disease (covid-19) can affect the sense of smell and taste of infected people. many organizations have recognized that covid-19 patients may have sudden loss of smell or taste and have included these symptoms in their diagnostic guidelines. many reports by physicians and patients during the 2019 to 2020 pandemic indicate that covid-19 is associated with elevated levels of odor and taste perception disorders (anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia, and/or dysgeusia). this mini review provides fundamental knowledge on coincidence of covid-19 infection and smell-taste perception disorders from an objective perspective. persistent smell and taste disorders have been reported as some of the most common symptoms after covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). 
Yeadon has said he personally doesn’t oppose the use of all vaccines.   It’s impossible to measure the impact of Yeadon’s claim that COVID-19 vaccines could cause female infertility. Anecdotally, though, many women have bought into it. https://t.co/GhJp0v0zLX [SEP] although these vaccines indicate the feasibility of protecting against disease, they have a number of shortcomings. among mothers who did not intend to vaccinate their daughters, the three most common reasons were daughter being too young to receive hpv vaccination (40.6%), fear of side effects (31.9%) and vaccine price is too high (16.0%). in addition, future hpv vaccination campaigns should address concerns about side effects, targeting men and women, given both their involvement in hpv vaccination decision-making. in the us military, service members must receive the yf vaccine before assignment to endemic areas, putting active duty service women at heightened risk for inadvertent exposure during preconception or pregnancy. few studies have investigated the safety of yf vaccination in pregnancy to date, and none in a military population. multivariable regression models estimated associations with yf vaccine exposure during preconception/pregnancy and adverse outcomes (e.g. in sensitivity analyses that excluded pregnancies exposed to other live vaccines, preconception yf vaccine exposure was associated with birth defects [adjusted risk ratio (arr) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.08-2.73]; this association was attenuated when further excluding infants with chromosomal anomalies (arr = 1.59, 95% ci = 0.97-2.62). overall, yf vaccine exposure did not appear to be associated with most adverse outcomes among this population of pregnant military women. a tenuous association between preconception yf vaccine exposure and birth defects was observed in sensitivity analyses, which may warrant further investigation. despite overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy and refusal leading to increases in the incidence of communicable diseases. 
 Remestemcel-L therapy heals vascular damage caused by covid ARDS & ther conditions like spinal, diabetic neuropathy reducing risk of amputations. It will treat heart tissue damage, graft v host. Bone stemcells are the future.Treatment is here! $msb $meso #mesoblast https://t.co/zaQH2hqLnW [SEP] cell-based therapy based on bone marrow transplantation is a promising option for patients with critical limb ischemia (cli). intracoronary and intramyocardial stem cell therapy aim at the repair of compromised myocardium thereby--as a causal treatment--preventing ventricular remodeling and improving overall performance. since the first-in-human use of bone marrow stem cells (bmcs) after acute myocardial infarction in 2001, a large number of clinical studies have demonstrated their clinical benefit: bmc therapy can be performed with usual cardiac catheterization techniques in the conscious patient as well as also easily during cardiosurgical interventions. stem cell therapy also represents an ultimate approach in advanced cardiac failure. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm- mscs) may ameliorate the consequences of cli due to their combinatorial potential for inducing angiogenesis and immunomodulatory environment in situ. stem cell transplant can induce vasculogenesis and improve the blood supply to an ischemic region, offering hope for chronic lower extremity ischemic diseases. regenerative medicine is the process of creating functional tissue with the aid of stem cells, to repair loss of organ function. we recently reported that lllt to the bone marrow (bm) led to proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) and their homing in the ischemic heart suggesting its role in regenerative medicine. a potential treatment for cardiovascular disease involves the transplantation of a patient's bone marrow stem cells into the heart of that same patient. the widespread application of cardiovascular stem cell therapies, however, will likely be based on pharmacological approaches to enhance the capacity of endogenous bone marrow stem cells to provide for the replacement of cardiac muscle and vascular cells after myocardial injury. 
Some people I know who survived covid infection seem to be prediabetic now. This seems to be a side effect of the infection, perhaps caused by inflammatory damage to the pancreas. Treatment with corticosteroids may cause more damage through elevated blood glucose. [SEP] prediabetes is a precursor of diabetes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. individuals with prediabetes reportedly have higher c-reactive protein levels, which is a risk factor for diabetes, relative to individuals with normal glucose regulation. prediabetes is a state of elevated plasma glucose in which the threshold for diabetes has not yet been reached and can predispose to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. thus, it is imperative to determine the mechanisms involved in the progression from prediabetes to diabetes including a clarification of how old and new medications affect oxidative and immune mechanisms of diabetes. in this review, we discuss the relationship between oxidative stress and hyperglycemia along with links between inflammation and prediabetes. infected children were found to require more insulin (1.2 vs 0.9 iu/kg/d) and their glycosylated hemoglobin a level was higher (14.9 vs 11.8) than the level found in uninfected subjects. the diabetes seen in acute pancreatitis is likely due to a combination of factors, including alerted insulin secretion, increased glucagon release, and decreased glucose utilization by the liver and peripheral tissue. the hyperglycemic environment causes disorders of the cells of innate immunity, which leads to reduced function of the immune system, and therefore diabetics are more susceptible to infections. due to immune dysfunction, infections are not only more common, but also more severe and with higher mortality than in people without diabetes. patients with diabetes mellitus have been reported to be at a high risk of complications from sars-cov2 virus infection (covid-19). 
Covid conundrum: vaccine known to cause headaches, sore arm, fatigue and nausea which are also symptom requiring testing. Must all vaccinated be tested? [SEP] suspected vaccine allergy may be a cause of incomplete or delayed vaccination. patients at risk of adverse reactions or suspected contraindications need specialized consultation about subsequent vaccinations. however, seemingly inexplicit adverse reactions have been described after the injection of the newer vaccines vs. human papillomavirus (hpv). different isolated cases and small series have described the development of complex regional pain syndrome (crps), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots), and fibromyalgia after hpv vaccination. clinicians should be aware of the possible association between hpv vaccination and the development of these difficult to diagnose painful dysautonomic syndromes. adjuvants are necessary components to warrant the efficacy of vaccines, however the overstimulation of the immune system is also associated with adverse effects. although symptoms are commonly reported following vaccinations, their causes are not always straightforward. although some may be directly attributable to the vaccine itself, others may reflect pre-existing or coincidental symptoms that are misattributed to the vaccine. side effect report was associated with lower vaccination intention for the following influenza season. perceiving side effects reduces future vaccination intention. 
   Several. Heart attack or brain stroke most common cause. That apart, lot of vaccinated people also contracting Covid in some weeks. Several getting serious and some fatalities too. [SEP] a number of neurological disease complications have been seen following infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). while most person with covid-19 respiratory disease demonstrate headache, nausea and vomiting, up to 40% present also experience dizziness, confusion, cerebrovascular disease, muscle pain, ataxia and seizures. coronavirus associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov-2) causes a worldwide syndrome called covid-19 that has caused 5,940,441 infections and 362,813 deaths until may 2020. we present 2 cases of patients infected with severe covid-19 that were hospitalized in the reanimation unit that presented cerebrovascular symptoms and died afterwards. globally, more than 12 million people have been infected with covid -19 infection till date with more than 500,000 fatalities. recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly cov disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 (sars-cov-2, early named 2019-ncov) occurred in wuhan, china, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until march 19, 2020. the coronavirus (cov) is a large family of viruses known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory tract infection. the severity of the infection may be visible as pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. case series without control groups suggest that covid-19 may cause ischemic stroke, but whether covid-19 is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke than would be expected from a viral respiratory infection is uncertain. the symptoms most commonly reported by patients affected by coronavirus disease (covid-19) include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. 
Makes perfect sense considering that asthma is a chronic lung inflammation, and COVID19 causes severe acute lung inflammation (hence the name SARS-Cov2, of which SARS stands for Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome).. can't get a lung infection if you already have it chronically. [SEP] the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) can cause mild, moderate or severe disease (covid-19). the sars-cov-2 is responsible for the pandemic covid-19 in infected individuals, who can either exhibit mild symptoms or progress towards a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). sars-cov-2, the virus causing the current covid-19 pandemic, primarily targets the airway epithelium and in lungs can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. the sars-cov2 infection triggers a multisystem inflammatory disorder, knowing as covid-19, a pandemic disease. sars-cov-2 affects part of the innate immune response and activates an inflammatory cascade stimulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, particularly within the lung. indeed, the inflammatory response during covid-19 is likely the cause for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). the coronavirus disease (covid-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) and presents with respiratory symptoms which can be life threatening in severe cases. at the start of the pandemic, allergy, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) were considered as risk factors for covid-19 as they tend to exacerbate during respiratory viral infections. sars-cov-2 is responsible for the development of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in infected individuals, who can either exhibit mild symptoms or progress toward a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) is the causative agent of a new disease (covid-19). 
Certainly not. We need much stricter #Idling laws to protect our #Children. #ToxicFumes cause #ChildAsthma stunt children’s #Lung and #Brain development and can cause life long #RespiratoryDisease. #ToxicAir also makes #coronavirus symptoms worse. Surely #ActiveTravel is needed https://t.co/InJAcViVDU https://t.co/rJ1puacgdF [SEP] this paper argues that legislation is needed to ban smoking in public places. it is important to focus on children with respect to air pollution because (1) their lungs are not completely developed, (2) they can have greater exposures than adults, and (3) those exposures can deliver higher doses of different composition that may remain in the lung for greater duration. children have higher baseline ventilation rates and are more physically active than adults, thus exposing their lungs to more air pollution. the observed consequences of early life exposure to adverse levels of air pollutants include diminished lung function and increased susceptibility to acute respiratory illness and asthma. children are more vulnerable to the risks of air pollution, including susceptibility to acquiring chronic diseases in their developing lungs. despite public health campaigns discouraging smoking, 1,000 american children every day become smokers, ensuring that tobacco-related health complications will be with us for decades to come. this paper reviews current information on the topic of children and smoking and offers some specific antismoking strategies. exposure to secondhand smoke (shs) harms all children's health, especially children with asthma. household smoking bans are being advocated to reduce children's harm from shs. the presence of a strict household smoking ban vastly reduced children's shs exposures and was associated with fewer cigarettes smoked by the mother and by other family members, the belief that shs was a personal health risk, having children with asthma, and living in a single-family home. 
   Why can't you comprehend nuance? They can be encouraged about ImmunityBio's 2nd gen hAd5 vaccine, which does not cause HIV issues, among other benefits. That doesn't mean it's the primary reason for doing the trial in SA. https://t.co/D67cCv9mLf [SEP] the investigational as04-adjuvanted herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2) glycoprotein d (gd2) subunit prophylactic vaccine ('hsv vaccine'; glaxosmithkline vaccines) has been shown to be well tolerated in adults, but limited data exist for pre-teen and adolescent girls, a likely target population. the primary objective of this study was to compare the occurrence of serious adverse events (saes) over 12 months between hsv vaccine recipients and saline recipients (placebo control group) in pre-teen and adolescent girls. healthy girls aged 10-17 years, stratified by age (10-15 years; 16-17 years), were randomised 2:1:1 to receive the hsv vaccine, a hepatitis a vaccine (havrix™; hav control) or placebo (saline) according to a 0-, 1-, 6-month schedule. this article considers a stage in the clinical trial process seldom documented in social sciences: recruitment of healthy volunteers for an hiv preventive vaccine trial through a media campaign. it analyzes one of the consequences of participating in such a clinical trial: the development of vaccine-induced seropositivity (visp) and how this biomedical notion is mobilized both in recruitment procedures' normative discourses and from the volunteers' points of view, and its consequences on their decision to participate. addressing visp phenomenon is important because it represents a major challenge for the information and the communication procedures for the next anti-hiv prophylactic trials recruitment campaigns. despite a wide array of safe and effective vaccines in use globally, with major impacts on health worldwide, the who strategic advisory group of experts (sage) on immunization has been repeatedly confronted with reports of hesitancy towards accepting specific vaccines or vaccination programmes. this paper summarizes the rationale for a sage review of the issue of vaccine hesitancy, its impact and ways to address it, and the convening of a vaccine hesitancy working group in march 2012 to prepare for the sage review. this observer-blind study (clinicaltrials.gov nct01462357) compared the immunogenicity and safety of 2 doses of the hpv-16/18 as04-adjuvanted vaccine (hpv-16/18(2d)) vs. 2 or 3 doses of the hpv-6/11/16/18 vaccine (hpv-6/11/16/18(2d) and hpv-6/11/16/18(3d)) in healthy girls aged 9-14 y. in this double blind randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 356 indian, non-pregnant residents aged 1 year or older were randomized to receive two doses of oral cholera vaccine at 14 and 28 day intervals. 
 AZ jabber here. I think there are 27m of us.. Am about to have 2nd one. My view is that Covid- or our immune response to Covid- can cause clotting in a very few unlucky folks. So you are still better off having the jab than Covid itself & at least we know what signs to look for [SEP] colicins are toxins that mediate interference competition in microbial ecosystems. we have previously shown that production of colicin ib (cib), a group b colicin, confers a competitive advantage to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. tm) over commensal e. coli strains. this reporter will be useful to further investigate the costs and benefits of colib production in human pathogenic s. tm and analyze cib expression under environmental conditions encountered in the mammalian gut. the arthritis-predisposing hla-b27 consists of a heavy chain, a small peptide, and the monomorphic beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m). ctls and a mab, ye-2, which recognize the complex with specificities both for the heavy chain and for the peptide, are available. two of the ctl clones were specific for hla-b27 cells experimentally infected with arthritis-causing yersinia enterocolitica. quantitative flow cytometry was carried out using antibodies directed separately against hla class i complex, free heavy chain a or b alleles. the level of expression correlated with the inflammation marker, erythrocyte sedimentation rate. free heavy chain-expressing monocytes infiltrated the synovium of an involved hip joint of a patient with as. this is the first patient-related evidence that surface free heavy chains of hla-b27 have to be considered as potential disease-causing molecules. 
   Vaxed could have lowered immune systems for days after the vaccination that could cause more problems. There are prophylatics available. Does Haiti use Ivermectin as standard and few covid cases and Dominican republic I think gave care staff,  doctors something different. Better? [SEP] use of cholera vaccines would likely have further reduced morbidity and mortality, but such vaccines are in short supply and little is known about effective vaccination strategies for epidemic cholera. in haiti, reactive vaccination was considered but, until recently, rejected in part due to limited global supply of vaccine. a comprehensive approach to cholera control is crucial, yet some have argued that oral cholera vaccination (ocv) might result in reduced hygiene practice among recipients. we evaluated the impact of an ocv campaign on knowledge and health practice in rural haiti. this paper traces the history of epidemics of poliomyelitis in jamaica from 1954 to 1982, the government's policies and strategies for immunization and demonstrates that preventive intervention through immunization is cheaper and preferable to crisis management caused by epidemics. following the 2010 earthquake, haiti was at heightened risk for vaccine-preventable diseases (vpds) outbreaks due to the exacerbation of long-standing gaps in the vaccination program and subsequent risk of vpd importation from other countries. therefore, partners supported the haitian ministry of health and population to improve vaccination services and vpd surveillance. during 2010-2016, three polio, measles, and rubella vaccination campaigns were implemented, achieving a coverage > 90% among children and maintaining haiti free of those vpds. in conclusion, haiti significantly improved vaccination services and vpd surveillance. this article provides an update on the available literature regarding vaccinations among this highly vulnerable population and describes the unique challenges of vpds during humanitarian emergencies. 
       COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. It’s not the Democrats providing the Covid-19 deaths it’s the CDC, Johns Hopkins and other healthcare professionals. [SEP] a new pandemic coronavirus causing coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19), initially called 2019-ncov and successively named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the covid-19 refers to the disease while the sars-cov-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. covid-19 is a new contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). covid-19 is a disease that has reached every continent in the world; it has overloaded the medical system worldwide and it has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization. emergence of the novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov-2) in december 2019 has led to the covid-19 pandemic. the highly infective coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) is caused by a novel strain of coronaviruses - the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) - discovered in december 2019 in the city of wuhan (hubei province, china). the novel covid-19 disease is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a new virus of the coronavirus family, sars-cov-2. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus. the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) is caused due to the infection by a unique single stranded enveloped rna virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (cov) called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). 
  Corona viruses is a group of viruses , well known for many many years  ...which cause the common cold but the COVID 19 is a new one and more dangerous than a common cold (in my opinion produced in a lab) [SEP] coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect humans, which may result in mild symptoms similar to those of the common cold. covid-19 is most recent subtype similar or even worse than the two previous pandemic strains which were the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). coronavirus disease (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new variable of the coronaviridae family. the novel covid-19 disease is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a new virus of the coronavirus family, sars-cov-2. coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause a wide range of illness from the common cold to more severe diseases. covid-19 causes illness in humans and has killed many people in the entire world. coronavirus disease (covid-19) is an inflammation disease from a new virus. coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19), caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has become a worldwide pandemic (1). the world is facing, while writing this review, a global pandemic due to one of the types of the coronaviruses (i.e., covid-19), which is a new virus. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease that has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, mainly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. 
Hypothesis. If #LongCovid is caused by some ongoing reaction from the immune system (auto-inflammation, auto-immunity). Maybe Rituximab could help to ease down again the over-reacting immune system (B-cells)? [SEP] rituximab, a b cell-depleting therapy, is indicated for treating a growing number of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disorders. these results demonstrate that rituximab is not fully effective at eliminating autoantibody-producing b cells and provide a mechanistic understanding of postrituximab relapse in musk mg. background rituximab induces long-lasting b cell depletion in the peripheral blood and increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines associated with regulatory b cell depletion. previous reports showed that b cell-related cytokine release after administration of rituximab may induce acute cellular rejection (acr) and delayed-onset neutropenia. rituximab-induced interstitial lung disease (r-ild) has aroused more concern in recent years. autoreactive b cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and b cell-depleting therapies using an antibodies, such as rituximab, have been suggested to be effective in ra treatment. rituximab is an anti-cd20 antibody used to deplete b lymphocytes in lymphoma and autoimmune disease. case reports in the literature describe patients who paradoxically develop autoimmune disease in response to rituximab therapy. we review the reports of autoimmune pathology in response to rituximab treatment and the proposed mechanisms of this reaction. those clinicians utilizing rituximab should be aware of this unusual phenomenon. 
    SARSCoV2 is the virus. Covid 19 is the disease it causes. Just like HIV is a virus and AIDS is the disease it causes. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Do you know anything Janet?    https://t.co/KZsHsqFUmU [SEP] coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) is a highly infectious illness caused by novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus. the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) is caused by the highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which has affected the global population despite socioeconomic status and amazed surveillance agencies for its incidence, mortality, and recovery rates. covid-19, also called coronavirus, is an infectious disease caused by sars-cov-2. covid-19, a novel identified coronavirus disease due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (sars-cov-2) infection, has posed a significant threat to public health worldwide. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has rapidly spread worldwide, threatening the health and lives of many people. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is considered to be spread primarily by people who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the actual coronavirus disease (covid 19) pandemic is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a member of the coronavirus family. sars-cov-2 is a new rna virus which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), declared a pandemic by the world health organization (who). covid-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the sars-cov-2 virus, previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) respiratory disease. covid-19 is a new contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). 
    Again anecdotally, I’ve spent the last few months giving falls leaflets and “Keeping Fit and Active” leaflets to my friends’ parents. I think the physical deconditioning from Covid has caused enormous problems in terms of falls risk, loss of muscle bulk and cognitive decline [SEP] the covid-19 pandemic may have decreased pa and increased sedentariness for several reasons (e.g., closure of gyms, family-related time constraints, and reduced outdoor mobility). falls, the leading cause of injury and death among older people, can have a significant psychosocial impact on carers. we identified that most carers had concerns about repeated falls in older people, unknown consequences of falls and care recipients' non-adherence to fall prevention advice. these concerns, in turn, affect carers' physical and psychological health, lifestyle, caregiving burden and use of fall prevention strategies. this paper highlights the importance of recognising carers' fall concern so as to identify carers' needs and awareness of fall prevention in older people living at home. greater insight into carers' fall concern could facilitate the implementation of new strategies to manage older people's fall risk as well as improve carers' well-being. a decrease in physical fitness seems logical as people survive burn injuries after an often extensive period of decreased activity and an increased demand of proteins leading to catabolism, especially of muscle mass. this study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the carers' fall concern instrument (cfc-i) for measuring carers' concern for older people (care recipients) at risk of falling. their concerns for older people at risk of falling have severe implications on carers' psychological well-being and ability to prevent falls. the newly developed multi-item cfc-i can be used to quantify the carers' level of fall concern and inform targeted interventions for carers when caring for older people who are at risk of falling. 
I was much more sad that my work won't allow me to bring banana bread for everyone because of covid than I was to find out the j&j vaccine could cause blood clots [SEP] i am gutted labour didn't win the election, as they promised to reintroduce the bursary. bread is one of the world’s most consumed food commodity. celiac disease is a serious condition affecting millions of individuals. a 24-year-old construction worker suffered burns of both lower legs when wet cement seeped into his work boots causing burns and secondary cellulitis severe enough to preclude working for four weeks. nurses are not just angry at the proposed abolition of special duty payments, they are livid. it is matter of basic bread and butter, not the cream on the cake. finally, my son got a mouthful of blood, and i gave up. i felt like a failure. it added to my depression, made me question my ability to mother, and caused my infant to lose too much weight.

 Here‘s why you should get the vaccine. Covid causes inflammation to the central nervous system and can cause damage including strokes and psychosis. Since you play a game that also causes brain injuries, it would be best for you to not have your brain fight both. [SEP] because vaccinations are common, even a small increased risk of multiple sclerosis (ms) or other acquired central nervous system demyelinating syndromes (cns ads) could have a significant effect on public health. to determine whether vaccines, particularly those for hepatitis b (hepb) and human papillomavirus (hpv), increase the risk of ms or other cns ads. vaccination of any type was associated with an increased risk of cns ads onset within the first 30 days after vaccination only in younger (<50 years) individuals (or, 2.32; 95% ci, 1.18-4.57). no patient reported any new neurological symptoms following the use of either vaccine. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. vaccination is one of the most effective and cost-efficient methods for protecting people with multiple sclerosis (ms) from infections. people with ms risk higher morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable infections. a safe and protective vaccine against cmv is highly desirable in view of the potential positive impact on cmv-associated morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare costs. 
 masks cause plague... fauci knows... masks promote bacteria... and not the good kind... sinus/lung/teeth and gum/tongue/etc... bacteriological infections... covid is crimes against humanity (:~:)https://t.co/VvPRwcVGPx [SEP] protective respiratory face masks protect the nose and mouth of the wearer from vapor drops carrying viruses or other infectious pathogens. however, incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the risk of pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. the use of biocidal masks may significantly reduce the risk of hand or environmental contamination, and thereby subsequent infection, due to improper handling and disposal of the masks. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has even resulted in a global shortage of face masks and the raw materials that go into them, driving individuals to self-produce masks from household items. this review will cover mask-wearing from the public health perspective, the technical details of commercial and home-made masks, and recent advances in mask engineering, disinfection, and materials and discuss the sustainability of mask-wearing and mask production into the future. since the start of the covid-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. the method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. in covid-19 pandemics days, wearing facial mask in public places has become obligatory to prevent the virus spread. wearing a face mask has become a cause célèbre, with implications of safety for oneself and others, trust in science, and being in defiance of or in lockstep with healthcare authority figures. 
 yeah pfzier causes blood clots and tumors too and j&j causes blood clots but they're RARE and you really don't want covid instead [SEP] these two respective processes, hitherto viewed as distinct, may in fact be functionally inseparable as blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, in their own right, influence tumor angiogenesis and thereby contribute to malignant growth. hemophilic pseudotumors result from repeated episodes of bleeding into bone, subperiosteum, and soft tissue. since clotting factors became available, uncontrolled perioperative bleeding is a less significant problem for surgeons in developed countries. in general, patients with thrombosis and malignancy need not be evaluated for hereditary or acquired hemostasis defects; finding one of these defects is both unlikely and will probably not alter antithrombotic therapy. hemorrhage in cancer patients is usually due to thrombocytopenia related to chemotherapy (particularly solid tumors) or bone marrow failure (usually leukemias), or disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic). two classic mpns, polycythemia vera (pv) and essential thrombocytosis (et), are conditions of excess proliferation of red blood cells and platelets, respectively. the management of both diseases involves minimizing the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. both pv and et can progress to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia, portending a poor prognosis. changes in the coagulability or rheology of the blood are supposed to cause an increased frequency of thrombosis in patients with a malignant tumor. these procoagulopathic disorders may not only increase the frequency of thrombosis but may also enlarge the extent of the thrombosis. 
AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine is linked to another bleeding disorder that can cause purple-dotted rash https://t.co/NhPMh8uQkI [SEP] the vaccine is well tolerated and has few adverse effects: the most common one is pain at the injection site. of 28 vaccinated patients, 5 [18%] had suspected breakthrough varicella; and 6/18 [33%] unimmunised patients required post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment for varicella. varicella is a highly communicable infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. this disease is characterized by a vesicular rash with dermatomeric extension and by moderate to severe pain. a proportion of individuals vaccinated with live attenuated oka varicella-zoster virus (vzv) vaccine subsequently develop attenuated chicken pox and/or herpes zoster. however, there have been reports of autoimmune side effects post vaccination. we therefore aim to investigate the possible relationship of severe autoimmune adverse events (arthritis, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, guillain-barre syndrome, optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis) post zoster vaccination with a matched case-control study of reported events in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). two varicella-containing vaccines are licensed for use in the united states: monovalent varicella vaccine (varivax [merck & co, inc, west point, pa]) and quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (mmrv) (proquad [merck & co, inc]). it is estimated from postlicensure data that after vaccination at 12 through 23 months of age, 7 to 9 febrile seizures occur per 10,000 children who receive the mmrv, and 3 to 4 febrile seizures occur per 10,000 children who receive the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) and varicella vaccines administered concurrently but at separate sites. thus, 1 additional febrile seizure is expected to occur per approximately 2300 to 2600 children 12 to 23 months old vaccinated with the mmrv, when compared with separate mmr and varicella vaccine administration. 
Secrets of ANCIENT AYURVEDA prevented AUTO IMMUNE DISEASES.CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL only IVERMECTIN can save planet from COVID (AS OF NOW),NOT VACCINES which causes every vaccinated human to be a DEVIL’S WORKSHOP to create MUTATED STRAINS OF SARS COV 2 VIRUS.  [NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZBFscnhjx1 [SEP] vaccinia virus (vacv) has had an important role for humanity because of its use during the smallpox eradication campaign. vaccinia virus (vacv) was instrumental in eradicating variola virus (varv), the causative agent of smallpox, from nature. vaccinia virus (vacv) is a notorious virus for a number of scientific reasons; however, most of its notoriety comes from the fact that it was used as a vaccine against smallpox, being ultimately responsible for the eradication of that disease. previously, we reported that our virus-free dna vaccine formulation, a pvax1 plasmid encoding codon-optimized vacv a27l gene (pa27lopt) with and without imiquimod adjuvant, stimulates a27l-specific production of ifn-γ and increases humoral immunity 7days post-vaccination. in all assays, the a27-based dna vaccine conferred protective immune responses. these results demonstrate that our vaccine formulation decreases viral replication and dissemination in a virus-free dna vaccine platform, and provides an alternative towards a safer an efficacious vaccine. vaccinia virus (vacv) has been used more extensively for human immunization than any other vaccine. vaccinia virus has played a huge part in human beings' victory over smallpox. with smallpox being eradicated and large-scale vaccination stopped worldwide, vaccinia has assumed a new role in our fight against another serious threat to human health: cancer. the efficacy of the vaccine is attributed to a robust production of protective antibodies against several envelope proteins of vacv, which cross-protect against infection with pathogenic varv. 
  The error in dealing with the Covid19 was preventing treatments without the so called vaccine. HCQ and Ivermectin were/are good treatments. That cause a large number of unnecessary deaths. And then the nursing home insanity. Bureaucrap and ComDem_Covid_Dictators. [SEP] without any pharmaceutical intervention and vaccination, the only way to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is to slow down the spread of the disease by adopting non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (phis). even in countries where healthcare systems still functioned, patients avoided visiting emergency departments (eds) because of fears of exposure to covid-19. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality. these data demonstrate that addition of hcq on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of covid-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. with no drugs currently approved for treatment and cure of covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), hydroxychloroquine is one of the many first-line drugs used in the management. considering its minimal risk and favorable safety profile, cost-effectiveness, availability, and affordability in india, the use of hydroxychloroquine in the fight against covid-19 appears rationale. the covid-19 outbreak is spreading worldwide pushing the national healthcare systems to find effective protocols to prevent contagion and to reduce the patients' mortality and the severity of long-term effects. covid-19 is a disease with no proven pharmaceutical intervention and no proven vaccine. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the covid-19 pandemic has affected human life significantly. 
Giving yourself a tension headache by worrying that you might get a headache which could indicate that you’ve developed blood clots after your covid jab, even though you know you didn’t have the one that can cause blood clots and just scared yourself reading the side-effects. https://t.co/0kokui7ui6 [SEP] tranylcypromine, a useful antidepressant agent, has been linked with a clinical syndrome of undetermined incidence characterized by exceedingly severe and prolonged headache. the occurrence of severe headache in the course of tranylcypromine therapy is an indication for immediate withdrawal of the drug. tranylcypromine cephalgia should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of sudden, violent and prostrating headache. the headache to worry about is one that is unique or different from headaches which the patient has suffered in the past. the association with the headache of meningismus or of focal neurologic symptoms of oculoparesis, other cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or loss of consciousness are particularly worrisome, especially if onset is recent and acute. headaches related to arteritis or vasculitis usually have a slower subacute course but may also produce focal neurologic deficits. for subjects over 50 years old, temporal arteritis is always a consideration and any new type of headache requires testing of the sedimentation rate to rule out this treatable but potentially devastating problem. sublingual hematoma secondary to anticoagulation is a rare fatal condition. this review covers the presentation, mechanisms, and management of transfusion reactions that are commonly encountered, and those that can be life-threatening. you may have had a panic attack. 
  I too have autoimmune disease. I have been vaccinated fully. The danger of Covid 19 outweighed the risk of side effects. The only side effect I had? Was flu like symptoms with the second dose. No lasting effect. The unvaccinated are the new 21 st century Lepers. Cause Variants [SEP] however, there is a concern regarding both vaccine-induced eosinophilic lung disease and eosinophil-associated th2 immunopotentiation following infection after vaccination. here, we review the anticipated characteristics of a covid-19 vaccine to avoid vaccine-associated eosinophil immunopathology. because side effects occur most often in first-time vaccinees, current plans for rapid large-scale vaccination in the event of bioterrorist attack raise concerns about the occurrence of a large number of adverse events. however, use of the classical live vacv vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., hiv-infected patients). despite the very low risk-to-benefit ratio of vaccines, fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis, and diphtheria. the resultant "black box" leads to a preoccupation with rare side effects (such as autoimmune diseases) that are speculated, but not proven, to be linked to some vaccinations. from november 2009 through february 2010, the authors identified recipients of h1n1 vaccines who were diagnosed with adverse events of special interest (aesis) in a large-linked safety database, and used the self-controlled case series (sccs) method to examine the risk of each aesi in the 0-42 days after h1n1 vaccination. the risks of other aesis were, in general, not increased in any of the predefined postvaccination risk periods and age groups. participants reporting being willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments conducted from april-october, 2020. concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. 
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause a disorder characterized by dangerous blood clots and low platelet counts. In Europe, at least 222 suspected cases have been reported among people who have received the vaccine. More than 30 have died. [SEP] reports of outbreaks of varicella in highly immunized groups have increased concern about the effectiveness of varicella vaccine. however, several adverse events have been described after vaccines, but a causal relationship has been established only in a minority of cases. here, we describe a pseudo-neurological syndrome occurred shortly after the administration of the bivalent hpv vaccine. some autoimmune disorders, including neurological demyelinating diseases, have been reported after hpv vaccines, but the patient showed no organic lesions. although some vaccinees will develop zoster, it is less common in recipients of vaccine than in those who have had natural varicella. in healthy children, the vaccine is efficacious and safe but because immunocompromised individuals may be unable to limit replication of live-attenuated vaccine viruses, the varicella vaccine is not recommended for them and there are few exceptions. several risk groups are known for the rare but serious, frequently fatal, viscerotropic reactions following live yellow fever virus vaccine (yel-avd). as vaccination programs continue to successfully control more and more infectious diseases, and the effects of these diseases become less visible, there has been increased focus on adverse events following immunization. most influenza vaccines are generally safe, but influenza vaccines can cause rare serious adverse events. this live viral vaccine has a wider array of rare but serious medical side effects (eg, eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, encephalitis, myopericarditis) compared with other vaccines that are given currently to the public. 
 Allopathic medicines are very costly. They eliminate the symptoms of diseases and cause other diseases in the body.  Asharamji Bapu has got many side effects in His body with allopathic medicines in the treatment of covid, so we demand for Ayurvedic medicine. #आयुर्वेद_हमारी_शान [SEP] in order to overcome this problem, the combination of western and eastern medicine has been proposed. ayurveda is traditional indian medicine established b.c. due to its effectiveness and fewer side effects, ayurveda will provide us with many hints for drug development. in the present review, we discuss the possible application of ayurveda in drug development taking into account the following two points, i) herbs used in ayurveda contain many unknown active components, and ii) ayurveda provides new therapeutic approaches. in the case of drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis, we get hints from active components in the herbs used in ayurveda. has been widely used in indigenous systems of indian medicine to exploit its medicinal properties including astringent, antidiarrheal, antidysenteric, demulcent, antipyretic, antiulcer, anti-inflammatory and anti cancer activities. background: ayurvedic medicines help in healing disease with fewer undesirable effects in comparison with an allopathic system of medicine to treat central nervous system (cns) disorders, as the latter is more expensive. in north east india, it is consumed predominantly and used as natural cure to treat various diseases. the involvement of debilitating side effects of allopathic antiasthmatic drugs provides a strong impetus for the development of new herbal therapeutics. f.) is well known as an important medical plant in the traditional ayurvedic system of medicine and it is used in numerous diseases (e.g. 
 LOSE WEIGHT!!!! More than 40% of US citizens are obese! Obesity causes diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, cancer, etc., i.e. exactly those underlying health problems which increase the risk of dying from Covid, also for younger people! LOSE WEIGHT NOW TO REDUCE RISK [SEP] obesity is an important risk factor for several disorders including cardiovascular disease, the first cause of death in the united states. obesity is an epidemic affecting about 40% of the us adult population. a burgeoning pandemic of obesity is well characterized. 41% of u.s. adults are projected to be obese by 2015 and obesity, a potentially modifiable risk, is emerging as a leading predictor of lifetime health. aggressive efforts must be targeted towards population-based strategies to educate and sensitize all generations on contributors to and sequelae of excess body mass as obesity represents one of the few modifiable factors that impact on the quantity and quality of lifespan. obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years. obesity is a chronic and debilitating disease that has become a global epidemic. obesity has a strong causal relationship with numerous serious comorbidities that impair quality of life, shorten life expectancy, and carry a major economic burden. extreme obesity, characterized by a body mass index (bmi) of 40 kg/m(2) or greater, is associated with significantly increased mortality, principally from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. this year the world kidney day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that makes preventive behaviors an affordable option. 
    COVID can cause horrible and debilitating secondary effects among those who survive. Lung, heart, and brain issues, as well as blood clots and circulation issues, have all been linked to COVID.  They don't go away when the initial infection is resolved. https://t.co/1gLEegZStL [SEP] the high numbers of covid-19 infections and deaths, economic difficulties, uncertainty about the future, as well as the approaches needed to contain the spread of the virus are all playing critical roles in the short and long-term social and psychological impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since the world wars; it can attack several systems in the body and has high complications and mortality. covid-19 can cause venous and arterial thromboembolism due to immobility, high inflammation, extensive intravascular blood coagulation, and hypoxia. these cases indicate that covid-19 may damage blood vessels in the brain and lead to stroke. in addition to the economic and social damage caused by covid-19 outbreak prolongation, damage caused by delayed treatment of other diseases such as severe cirrhosis is also serious. while the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases, individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. the current coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic continues to overwhelm healthcare systems and to exert a negative influence on the global economy. novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a 2020 pandemic, has resulted in an unexpected loss in lives, quality of life, and the economy. the covid-19 clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to death, and its complications may involve various organs. the symptoms of infection can be devastating or at the least very debilitating for vulnerable individuals. 
 My family of 4, NO SIDE EFFECTS!! Just saw a Real Housewife blaming her ZIT on the Covid vaccine! People are so damn stupid!! Vaccines don't cause pimples!! [SEP] harmlessness for the mother and the child has been observed for seasonal, pandemic, or quadrivalent influenza, mono, combined polysaccharide or conjugated meningococcal or pneumococcal, tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis, human papillomavirus, cholera, hepatitis a, japanese encephalitis, rabies, anthrax, smallpox, yellow fever, mumps, measles and rubella combined, typhoid fever, inactivated or attenuated polio vaccines, and bacillus calmétte guerin vaccines. instead, the beneficial effects of influenza vaccine for the mother and the child as well as of pertussis vaccine for the child have been demonstrated. no major vaccine reactions were observed. we present the case of a 4-year-old immunocompetent girl with varicella-zoster virus (vzv) that occurred 45 months after a single dose of the varicella vaccine. vaccine refusal harms and risks harming innocent bystanders. few side effects and no generalized vaccinal infection were observed. with increasing availability of private varicella vaccination, this article reviews the pros and cons of whether parents should be immunising their children with the chickenpox vaccine privately. although serious reactions are rare, convulsions occur in one per 1,000 children vaccinated in england, and malaise after vaccination is common. varicella-zoster virus vaccine has diminished the consequences of chicken pox in terms of health and economical burden. we report here the case of an immunocompetent 3(1/2)-year-old girl who developed encephalitis and herpes zoster opthalmicus 20 months after her immunization with varicella-zoster virus vaccine. 
    Ffs! I don't know how many more times it can be explained to people really.[NEWLINE]Just because you have cancer or a brain tumour or anything else terminal. There are other causes of death that expedite the original cause of illness. Covid is one of those things. [SEP] although there is a plethora of cancer associated-factors that can ultimately culminate in death (cachexia, organ impairment, metastases, opportunistic infections, etc. the increasing use of expensive cancer treatments close to the patient's death is often explained by oncologists' failure to communicate to patients how close to dying they are, implying that patients are often both ill-prepared and over-treated when they die. the true reason why cancer patients die is not absolutely clear. understanding how cancer cells kill people can elucidate therapeutic approaches that might benefit our patients. finally, the author pledges to support research to understand the reason why many of our patients die. to determine if people dying from cancer are able to prolong their own life in order to experience a certain biographical event, or whether the appearance of such an occasion leads to increased deaths before the event. as a psychogenic postponement or hastening of death is most likely in chronic diseases (as opposed to accidents or cardiovascular events), we included cancer deaths only. causes of death were respiratory failure, infections, and/or liver failure in 49.9, 23.9, and 19.4% of patients, respectively. the long period between a possible first event and the point of no return, gives appeal to the belief that life events other than "material" causes may play a role in cancer. however, the often unpredictable illness trajectories and the difficulty in predicting the imminence of death in people with non-cancer conditions may hamper the provision of high-quality palliative care. 
Brazil regulator rejects Sputnik V vaccine citing serious quality, safety concerns. Cells where adenovirus is produced “allow its replication,” which “can lead to infections in humans and can cause injury and death” #COVID19 #coronavirus  #CoronaVaccine  https://t.co/OHd3NbLcEm [SEP] however, the treatment-related death of a patient with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency following adenovirus administration by hepatic artery has led to serious concerns regarding the safety of intravascular adenovirus. over 100 cancer patients have been treated with intravascular adenovirus constructs to date with an acceptable toxicity profile; further clinical trial testing appears appropriate in cancer patients. human adenovirus (adv) can cause fatal disease in immune-suppressed individuals, but treatment options are limited, in part because the antiviral cytidine analog cidofovir (cdv) is nephrotoxic. arboviruses are an important public health problem in brazil, in especially flaviviruses, including the saint louis encephalitis virus (slev) and the rocio virus (rocv), are especially problematic. a recent clinical trial of a t-cell-based aids vaccine delivered with recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rad5) vectors showed no efficacy in lowering viral load and was associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection. the presence of replication-competent adenovirus (rca) is a safety concern for biologics based on recombinant adenoviruses and rca testing is therefore mandatory for release of clinical material. human adenovirus (hadv) infections are increasingly frequent and potentially fatal as a disseminated disease in highly immunocompromised patients. human adenovirus (hadv) can cause severe disease in certain at-risk populations such as newborns, young children, the elderly and individuals with a compromised immune system. both replication-incompetent and replication-selective adenoviruses are being developed for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. concerns have been raised about the safety of intra-vascular adenovirus administration following a patient death on a clinical trial with a replication-defective adenovirus. 
Such a dangerous decision. There were 6 instances out of 7 million vaccinations. Blood clots are a known complication of COVID-19, so it is not surprising that the immune response may cause them. Further, FDA approved birth control has an incidence of 1 in 1,000, yet still used. https://t.co/gOEZlCOQMu [SEP] bleeding following vaccination should be recognized as an important aefi as even a small amount of blood loss in young infants can be catastrophic. the administration of vaccines is not usually recommended in pregnant women because of a fear of severe adverse events for the fetus. although the meningococcal conjugate menacwy-crm vaccine is not approved for use in pregnant women, unintentional exposure during pregnancy can occur, especially during early pregnancy among women of child-bearing age. this study provides safety information about inadvertent menacwy-crm vaccination during pregnancy. we performed a case-control study in the vaccine safety datalink that was matched 1:4 on site, month, and year of last menstrual period, comparing the odds of vaccination in pregnancies that ended in stillbirth (defined as fetal loss at or after 20 weeks of gestation) compared with those that ended in live birth from january 1, 2012, to september 30, 2015. in our matched analysis of 795 confirmed stillbirths in the case group and 3,180 live births in the control group, there was no significant association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and stillbirth (343/795 [43.1%] stillbirths in the case group vs 1,407/3,180 [44.3%] live births in the control group, or 0.94, adjusted or 0.95, 95% ci 0.79-1.14, p=.54) and no significant association between tdap vaccination during pregnancy and stillbirth (184/795 [23.1%] stillbirths in the case group vs 746/3,180 [23.5%] live births in the control group, or 0.97, aor 0.96, 95% ci 0.76-1.28, p=.91). these findings support the safety of acip recommendations for vaccination during pregnancy. vaccination of women with live virus vaccines around conception has always been contraindicated by the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the vaccine manufacturer because of potential risks to the fetus. campaigns avoid giving vaccine to pregnant women because of the absence of safety data of the killed whole-cell oral cholera (rbs-wc) vaccine. the outcome of pregnancies that were inadvertently exposed to at least one oral cholera vaccine dose and those that were not exposed was evaluated. 
           In other words (translation into English), what u and those looking at cholinergic system disruption ( ) are saying is that neurological distress  leads to respiratory distress in covid, that neuro-mediated hypoximia causes covid pneumonia? [SEP] in this article, subarachnoidal hemorrhage developing in a case with covid-19-related pneumonia was evaluated. in the presence of respiratory system infection signs such as cough and weakness in patient who present with sudden loss of consciousness, performing lung imaging as well as performing brain computerized tomography scan can allow the detection of an underlying covid-19 infection. respiratory disease syndrome (rds) is a condition of neonatal calves in which insufficient oxygen uptake and increased retention of carbon dioxide result in respiratory acidosis. respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection causes severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and calves. an illustrative case is presented, and pulmonary hypoplasia is suggested as an etiology of the respiratory difficulties observed. pneumonia is a severe lower respiratory tract infection that is a common complication and a major cause of mortality of the vitamin c-deficiency disease scurvy. this suggests an important link between vitamin c status and lower respiratory tract infections. the pneumonia cohort also exhibited significantly elevated protein carbonyl concentrations compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.001), indicating enhanced oxidative stress in the patients. overall, the depleted vitamin c status and elevated oxidative stress observed in the patients with pneumonia indicates an enhanced requirement for the vitamin during their illness. respiratory disease is a common reason for hospitalization and mortality in persons with severe intellectual and developmental disability. 
   You are mistaken.  COVID-19 antibodies are ONLY made when a person gets the virus.  Whether a person gets sick depends on how healthy their immune system is or other factors.  Vaccines cause antibodies to be made by a person, without getting sick, just like in asym infections. [SEP] vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. however, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of covid-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. to inform our understanding, we analyze research about the immune mechanisms implicated in sars-cov, from the 2003 outbreak, and sars-cov-2, the virus causing covid-19. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. a significant portion of the u.s. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new covid-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. pandemic h1n1 vaccination induced a strong 4.63-fold (iqr 4.16) increase in antigen-specific cd4(+)  t cells that was more pronounced in individuals not prevaccinated with seasonal influenza (p = 0.01). likewise, prevaccination with seasonal influenza induced a less pronounced increase in specific antibodies. influenza-specific t cells in vaccinees had a th1 phenotype mainly coexpressing ifn-γ and il-2, whereas patients with active pandemic influenza showed a shift toward cells predominantly expressing ifn-γ. vaccines are a powerful measure to protect the health of individuals and to combat outbreaks such as the covid-19 pandemic. the extensive efforts around the globe are being made to develop a suitable vaccine against covid-19 (coronavirus disease-19) caused by sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2). 
 We need to realize that COVID is a disorder of the Immune system. A disordered immune response leads to acute critical COVID and chronic inflammation causes PASC, #Leronlimab is an immunomodulator that has shown to help both groups of patients! [SEP] dysregulation of the immune system undoubtedly plays an important and, perhaps, determining role in the covid-19 pathogenesis. similar to those illnesses, the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), several immunotherapies were applied to modulate the immune responses of the affected patients. in this review, we aimed to describe the role of the immune system in response to covid-19. immune dysregulation characterized by t cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe covid-19. the sars-cov2 infection triggers a multisystem inflammatory disorder, knowing as covid-19, a pandemic disease. this disease is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine-driven hyperinflammation, and leukocytes count changes. severe covid-19 can manifest in rapid decompensation and respiratory failure with elevated inflammatory markers. patients with primary glomerular disease and glomerular disease secondary to systemic diseases who are on moderate to high doses of immunosuppression are at an increased risk of covid because of their immunosuppressed state. the patients on immunosuppression need to modify the drugs balancing the risk relapse and flare of the disease, simultaneously minimizing the risk of developing covid. 
      I wish more attention would be paid to the importance of the Pentose-Phosphate-Pathway in optimal immune function & how COVID demands G6PD/NADPH, etc - & inability of the body to supply can cause ALL severe &/or long reactions [SEP] severe influenza is characterized by cytokine storm and multiorgan failure with metabolic energy disorders and vascular hyperpermeability. infection of mice with influenza a pr/8/34(h1n1) virus resulted in marked down-regulation of pdh activity and atp level, with selective up-regulation of pdk4 in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver and lungs. 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgdh), the third enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (ppp), is essential for biosyntheses and oxidative stress defence. glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency facilitates human coronavirus infection due to glutathione depletion. g6pd deficiency may especially predispose to hemolysis upon coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) infection when employing pro-oxidant therapy. we describe a severe case of covid-19 infection in a g6pd-deficient patient treated with hydroxychloroquine who benefited from intravenous (iv) nac beyond reversal of hemolysis. the pentose phosphate pathway (ppp, a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis) converts glucose-6-phosphate into pentoses and generates ribose-5-phosphate and nadph thereby governing anabolic biosynthesis and redox homeostasis. brains and immune cells display high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), the rate-limiting enzyme of the ppp. mechanistically, microglia with elevated g6pd activity/expression produced excessive nadph and provided abundant substrate to over-activated nadph oxidase (nox2) leading to production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ros). our findings indicated that g6pd-mediated ppp dysfunction and neuroinflammation exacerbated each other mediating chronic dopaminergic neurodegeneration and locomotor impairment. 
  Yes, COVID-19 can cause various problems. The VACCINE cannot. [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has caused serious damage to public health. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and previous pandemics have been viewed almost exclusively as virology problems, with toxicology problems mostly being ignored. this perspective is not supported by the evolution of covid-19, where the impact of real-life exposures to multiple toxic stressors degrading the immune system is followed by the sars-cov-2 virus exploiting the degraded immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to covid-19. they increase the likelihood for comorbidities and mortality associated with covid-19. the covid-19 pandemic, after it was reported in december 2019, is a highly contagious and now spreading to over 190 countries, causing a severe public health burden. currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat covid-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, sars-2-cov. however, even after this pandemic, covid-19 may still have a chance to come back. covid-19 pandemic is a global health crisis in the 21st century. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) infection, is a pandemic causing havoc globally. the covid-19 pandemic has not only had a negative impact on people's health and life behavior, but also on economies around the world. 
  Covid 19 causes blood clots that trigger heart attacks and strokes, explains why he was in perfect condition a few weeks ago, but the disease was silently ravaging his body [SEP] covid-19, a disease initially thought to be prominently an interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of severity, can be considered a vascular disease with regards to serious complications and causes of mortality. quite recently, blood clots have emerged as the common factor unifying many of the symptoms initially attributed without an explanation to covid-19. patients with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to have severe illness due to covid-19 and are at increased risk for complications and mortality. covid-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state causing cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. to further characterize cerebrovascular disease (cvd) in covid-19, we review the current literature of published cases and additionally report the clinical presentation, laboratory and diagnostic testing results of 12 cases with covid-19 infection and concurrent cvd from two academic medical centers in houston, tx, usa, between march 1 and may 10, 2020. in patients with embolic stroke of unclear etiology, covid-19 may have played a direct or indirect role in the processes that eventually led to the strokes while in the remaining cases, it is unclear if infection contributed partially or was an incidental finding. covid-19 causes significant hypoxia along with an exacerbated inflammatory milieu, which may be a trigger for atherosclerotic plaque rupture and/or thromboembolic events. herein, we presented a case of covid-19 presented with acute coronary syndrome followed by pulmonary thromboembolism and cerebrovascular accident. the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) has been associated with thromboembolic complications, but evidence on its impact on hemorrhagic risk are still scarce. we describe a case of covid-19 with hemorrhagic complication in the post-acute phase of the disease. 
Oxygen deprivation caused by face masks is weakening your immune system and harming your body.  Do not consent to this ritual which does nothing to prevent illness but actually causes it. #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #Health #healthylifestyle #HealthyLiving #healthy [SEP] wearing a face mask has become a cause célèbre, with implications of safety for oneself and others, trust in science, and being in defiance of or in lockstep with healthcare authority figures. social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. there is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of masks in the general population for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in public areas. to assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. logistic regression found that mask wearing was associated with a reduction in face touching in china (odds ratio [or], 3.91; 95% ci, 2.11-7.24) and south korea (or, 6.69; 95% ci, 2.69-16.69) and of touching the nose, mouth, and eyes (china: or, 8.60; 95% ci, 2.65-27.86; south korea: or, 29.27; 95% ci, 1.79-478.22). the findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that mandatory mask-wearing policies were associated with increased mask wearing during the covid-19 pandemic. mask wearing was associated with reduced face-touching behavior, especially touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which may prevent contact transmission of covid-19 among the general population in public areas. in covid-19 pandemics days, wearing facial mask in public places has become obligatory to prevent the virus spread. in addition to its valuable protection, wearing facial mask can affect verbal communication in an adverse fashion and makes mutual understanding difficult. 
      It can be vasovagal syncope (which is basically a faint) - this is relatively common with flu for example which can cause people to feel dizzy/faint, but also with stress. It could be completely unrelated - e.g. a heart arrhythmia leading to collapse. [SEP] syncope is usually easily diagnosed, but sometimes it is confused with hypoglycemia, epilepsy, cerebral vascular disease, "drop attacks", hyperventilation attacks, and hysterical faints. syncope is usually a benign disorder, but sometimes it is a manifestation of a serious neurologic or cardiac disease. syncope, defined as the temporary loss of consiousness and postural tone resulting from an abrupt transient decrease in cerebral blood flow, is a common usually benign self-limiting event. a healthy 42-year-old male patient presented to the neurology clinic with a long history of faints triggered by spontaneous laughter, especially after funny jokes. neurocardiogenic syncope (ncs, simple fainting) is a common and typically benign familial condition, which rarely may result in traumatic injury or hypoxic convulsions. we recorded fainting frequency, resting heart rate variability measures and anxiety levels. cough syncope is classified among the neural-reflex "situational" faints, but whether the clinical consequences in affected individuals result from reflex triggered bradyarrhythmia or vasodepressor-induced hypotension, or both, is often unknown. cardiac syncope may be due to mechanical or structural factors. vasodepressor (vasovagal) syncope, the most common cause of acute loss of consciousness, can occur in otherwise vigorously healthy people during exposure to stimuli decreasing cardiac filling. though relatively common, syncope is a complex presenting symptom defined by a transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by falling, and with spontaneous recovery. 
 Masks are a total hoax!! They do not stop the spread of corona virus,in fact bacteria levels are high from wearing the mask a couple of hours&we breathe in all that bacteria in to our lungs which can/does cause pneumonia&pneumonia kills. Let that sink In. Masks can kill us. [SEP] the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreaks. personalized face masks with smart nano-assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front-line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications. face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission. wearing face masks has been widely recommended to contain respiratory virus diseases, yet the improper use of masks poses a threat of jeopardizing the protection effect. our results improve the safe use of masks and benefit the environment. mandates for mask use in public during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, worsened by global shortage of commercial supplies, have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. it is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. it becomes common to wear a disposable face mask to protect from coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) amid this pandemic. the common chemical warfare protective masks impose an excessive respiratory load on the wearer due to elevated breathing resistance and increased dead space. 
 I don't consider ppls fears irrational in the least.  AZ drops platelets=could impact ppl with blood cancer badly.  TTS is extremely rare, meaning few things cause it other than AZ & Heparin.  The other name for it is 'Vaccine induced TTS'. 61 cases so far https://t.co/HqEMGTHIS7 [SEP] other adverse events directly associated with the vaccine include reversion to virulence of attenuated vaccine strains of organisms, or contamination of the vaccine product. autoimmune reactions reliably considered vaccine-associated, include guillain-barré syndrome after 1976 swine influenza vaccine, immune thrombocytopenic purpura after measles/mumps/rubella vaccine, and myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination, whereas the suspected association between hepatitis b vaccine and multiple sclerosis has not been further confirmed, even though it has been recently reconsidered, and the one between childhood immunization and type 1 diabetes seems by now to be definitively gone down. general physicians, pediatricians and parents realize that serious adverse events occur with an extremely rare incidence, but have no information on the incidences of vaccine-associated adverse events. the total estimated incidence of serious neurological illness after vaccination was 0.1-0.2 per million immunization practices. the most important reasons cited by the opponents of vaccines are concerns about vaccine safety. unlike issues such as autism for which no indisputable documentation of direct relationship with vaccine use is available, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) is an adverse event that can really follow vaccine administration, and may limit vaccine use because little is known about which vaccines it may follow, its real incidence and severity, the risk of chronic disease, or the possibility of recurrences after new doses of the same vaccine. the main aim of this review is to clarify the real importance of thrombocytopenia as an adverse event and discuss how it may interfere with recommended vaccination schedules. adverse events (aes) after hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) infusion are rare but might be life-threatening. the incidence of aes on a cohort of 460 patients (490 hpc infusions) undergoing autologous dmso-reduced hpc transplantation was prospectively evaluated. however, reports of postvaccination serious adverse events such as autoimmunity, although rare, have caused great concerns among the general public. 
  It isn’t denial... the real issue is the mental health problems that your lockdown measures have and will cause.  Suicides and opioid OD are going to be far higher than any Covid deaths and to much younger and physically healthier individuals. [SEP] if left untreated, the likelihood of subsequent arrest increases and risk for adverse health consequences is great, particularly among opioid users. rates of suicide and opiate overdose have recently skyrocketed in the united states. many of these individuals with opiate use disorder (oud) exaggerate suicidality to get prompt psychiatric care to treat the oud. substance use disorders (sud) and mental health disorders are significant public health issues that co-occur and are associated with high risk for suicide attempts. documentation of suicide attempts during imprisonment indicates awareness, but also suggest a need to continue enhancing screening and evaluating environmental settings. people detained in high security hospitals are recognised for their violence to others, but perhaps less so for their suicide potential. suicide is a major public health problem; rates in the us have risen significantly across all age groups over the past decade. this study aims to examine the pros and cons of mental health treatment utilization and non-utilization from the perspective of depressed individual with suicidal ideation via a decisional balance worksheet. depressed adults with suicidal ideation presenting to an emergency room for treatment recorded the pros and cons they associate with mental health treatment utilization and non-utilization. suicide is a major health problem accounting for 9% of all deaths. 
  To quote from the article "There is no proof, however, that the vaccine caused these cases" Also "COVID-19 itself can cause myocarditis" [SEP] during the early stages of the pandemic, some coronavirus disease (covid-19) patients were misdiagnosed as having influenza, which aroused the concern that some deaths attributed to influenza were actually covid-19-related. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been demonstrated to be the cause of pneumonia. laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. covid-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. this is the first report of covid-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis. the mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by covid-19 needs further study. coronavirus disease (covid-19) sparked global concern for its outbreak and pandemic. covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), due to infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), is now causing a global pandemic. with the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), our knowledge of the pathogenesis of covid-19 is still in its infancy. 
 People are not experts at understanding absolute and relative risk. -The vaccine may cause this as do other meds and infections -The risk is so low that it's hard to find a background rate and prove it's above baseline -It's a hell of a lot lower than thrombotic risk of COVID [SEP] despite the very low risk-to-benefit ratio of vaccines, fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis, and diphtheria. the focus of this review article is to open this black box and provide a conceptual framework for how vaccine safety is traditionally assessed. vaccination complacency occurs when perceived risks of vaccine-preventable diseases are sufficiently low so that vaccination is no longer perceived as a necessary precaution. severe immunologically mediated reactions are rare and less common with the vaccine than the true infection. one potential driver of vaccine skepticism is how people process event frequencies such as rare adverse reactions to vaccines. higher levels of vaccine skepticism were associated with lower accuracy in frequency estimation and over-estimation of rare events. in the absence of immediate risk, ethical issues arise because even smaller risks associated with the vaccine are greater than the immediate disease risk (which is zero). although these vaccines may prove to be less reactogenic, they still may not be administered safely to a significant portion of the population because they contain live, attenuated viruses. vaccine-preventable disease levels in the united states are at or near record lows. myths and misinformation about vaccine safety abound and can confuse parents who are trying to make sound decisions about their children's health care. 
 So much fake news on this Covid is clearly a  virus and , yes,with a compromised immune system Bacteria will thrive. Covid kills by clotting and, particularly in damaging lung efficiency. Hypoxia can cause heart failure. [SEP] the clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. the thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. in this review, we especially wanted to describe the virus effects on the cardiovascular system, probably the leading cause of death of thousands of deceased patients. therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe covid-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin i and inflammatory cytokines. covid-19 derives from infection with coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov-2] and is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thrombogenic agents resulting in destruction of the lungs. covid-19 (sars cov-2) has become a deadly, world-wide pandemic. covid-19 is a highly contagious virus which almost freezes the world along with its economy. the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 causes covid-19, a pandemic threatening millions. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the causative agent of cov disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible cov that is presently plaguing the global human population and economy. covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications. 
 Covid causes heart inflammation in like 70% of people (including asymptomatic).  That seems like a high rate of heart inflammation. [SEP] myocarditis, i.e. inflammation of the myocardium, is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death (scd) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) in young adults, and is an important cause of symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea and palpitations. however, since serologic markers for c. pneumoniae infection also seem to be associated with uncomplicated atherosclerosis and other chronic conditions, their predictive value for cardiac events is small. coronary heart disease is multifactorial inflammatory process which involves the accumulation of lipid macrophages and intimal plaques in smooth muscle cell in large and medium sized arteries. c reactive protein (crp) which is an inflammatory marker is considered as global risk assessment for coronary heart disease. increased c-reactive protein (crp) has been associated with cvd, in those presenting after an acute coronary event, and also in apparently healthy individuals. myocarditis is a multifactorial disorder, characterized by an inflammatory reaction in the myocardium, predominantly triggered by infectious agents, but also by antigen mimicry or autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. treatment strategies aim to resolve chronic inflammation and preserve cardiac function. this review describes concept and contemporary strategies to alleviate myocardial inflammation and sheds light on potential inflammatory targets in an evidence-based order. recent studies found a myocardial viral genomic persistence in up to 67% of dcmid patients, indicating a possible inflammatory etiology (dcmi). 
  My 6 year old was stressed too.  I just told him some mainicured facts. The AZ vaccine uses a virus which can cause the common cold to transport the material which helps your body learn how to beat COVID. So sometimes you get some similar effects to a cold or flu.  Seemed to help [SEP] if a child has a reaction to a vaccine, it is likely to disrupt his immunization schedule with risks to himself and the community. vaccination should be a priority in the entire child population, so this document describes particular situations of allergic children to minimize the risk of immunizations and achieve safe vaccination. one and the same series of live influenza vaccine from the strains b/dushanbe/66 and b/leningrad/67 or a2/moscow/21/65 administered intranasally to non-immune persons in leningrad and 'krasnodar in winter caused an increase in body temperature in 6.7-8% of vaccinated subjects, but in summer in 0.8%. varicella vaccination of children has decreased varicella disease incidence, but introduced the occurrence of herpes zoster (hz) from vaccine-type virus. cold-adaptation was used to develop a vaccine line (ca a/aa/6/60 h2n2) which promised to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and to serve as a model for other live virus vaccines. vaccination can be a significant source of pain for pediatric patients, which could result in fear of medical procedures and future reluctance to seek medical care. this study sought to measure the impact of an intervention combining cold and vibration on pain scores during routine pediatric immunization. a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of the buzzy device (thermomechanical stimulation) compared to no intervention (control group) in reducing child-reported pain during routine immunization. thermomechanical stimulation with the buzzy device significantly reduced pain during pediatric immunization over a wide range of ages compared to control, but did not impact pre-procedure anxiety. the buzzy device is an easy to implement intervention to reduce pediatric pain during vaccination. 
   I do But they are hardly bad for you also Experimental ones sure   But vaccines save more lives then risk any day  The covid vaccine cause me to vomit and made me very poorly But I hadn't taken vets and my immune system was in tatters so meh [SEP] though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, aids, and parasitic diseases including malaria. although, the risks of vaccine-associated adverse events are extremely low, the occurrence of such events in areas with high immunization coverage levels and low incidence of vaccine preventable diseases can influence public acceptance of immunization services. despite these realities, there are an alarming number of parents who do not permit the vaccination of their children as scheduled. some key historical aspects of vaccine hesitancy are presented. while extremely potent vaccines have been developed that can protect practically a lifetime after a single dose, numerous other vaccines have utterly failed or provide only marginal protection. the current live vaccinia virus vaccine used in the prevention of smallpox is contraindicated for millions of immune-compromised individuals. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. vaccine refusal harms and risks harming innocent bystanders. although a highly effective vaccine against smallpox, vaccinia virus (vv) is not without adverse events, some of which can be life-threatening, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. 
  Nothing like that ..... Now the reason the vaccine will cause this it's a side effect when one takes the vaccine. Covid-19 does not cause erectile distinction. [SEP] since the hpv vaccine protects against a sexually transmitted virus, one barrier to uptake specific to the hpv vaccine may be the concern that vaccination may encourage risky sexual behaviour. unanimous findings from recent studies show that hpv vaccination does not lead to sexual risk compensation, which is an important message to parents, clinicians and other decision-makers regarding hpv vaccination. some parents of adolescents have concerns that vaccination will encourage sexual behavior and therefore choose not to vaccinate. previous studies investigating vaccination and sexual behavior have included only young women and girls. the objective of this study is to assess associations between hpv-vaccination and sexual behavior in a college-age cohort of both men and women. here, we consider vaccination status, sexual behavior, and substance use among 241 college-aged men and women. hpv vaccination status was not significantly associated with an increased likelihood of sexual debut (odds ratio: 0.80 (95% ci: 0.41-1.58), decreased age of sexual debut (hazard ratio: 0.81 (95% ci: 0.65-1.00), nor an increased number of sexual partners (per year sexually active; incidence rate ratio: 1.27 (95% ci: 0.86-1.87)) in this cohort, after controlling for age, race, sex, and substance use. concerns about the influence of the hpv vaccine on sexual behavior are likely unfounded for both men and women. the actual effectiveness of the still-to-come vaccination against the coronavirus sars-cov-2 might be challenged by vaccine hesitancy, a rather common and known phenomenon whose psychological predictors are, nevertheless, still largely debated. might covid-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) breakthrough infections? 
‼️”all covid-19 vaccines cause deadly blood clots...travel to the brain, heart, lungs & other organs, causing strokes, heart attacks (rapper DMX was killed this way), pulmonary embolisms...&other...none of which...officially listed as "vaccine" deaths” https://t.co/joO5hAIfWV [SEP] this article reports the clinical features of a covid-19 patient whose first symptom was cerebral hemorrhage. this case suggests that covid-19 may infringe on cerebral blood vessels and cause cerebral hemorrhage. the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since the world wars; it can attack several systems in the body and has high complications and mortality. covid-19 can cause venous and arterial thromboembolism due to immobility, high inflammation, extensive intravascular blood coagulation, and hypoxia. these cases indicate that covid-19 may damage blood vessels in the brain and lead to stroke. the covid-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the u.s., which leads globally in total cases and deaths. venous thromboembolism (vte) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) are frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complications among hospitalized patients of covid-19 infection. a relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is worrying, and the application of heparin in covid-19 has been assessed and recommended with some expert consensus because of the risk of dic and venous thromboembolism. novel coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) is an ominous infectious disease that seems capable to attack any organ system, leading in the most severe cases to patient death. covid-19 has been associated with multiple cardiovascular complications of inflammatory and immune origin, leading to a wide spectrum of vascular damage, myocardial injury, stroke, and pulmonary obstruction. 
"Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may directly cause psychiatric morbidity through cerebral infection or hyperinflammation [2]. Recovery in Long COVID is multi-faceted and we recommend mental health ". [SEP] enhanced treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving interferon-α requires 1) addressing preexisting mental health problems, 2) alleviating psychiatric conditions that emerge during treatment, and 3) prediction and prevention of these conditions. hepatitis c virus infection is frequently associated with mental clouding, depression, neurocognitive impairment, and deterioration in the quality of life. in recent studies psychiatric symptoms have been linked to psychiatric comorbidity rather than to direct hepatitis c virus neurotoxicity. hepatitis c virus infection is associated with psychiatric comorbidity and injection drug use, while treatment of the virus is frequently accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms. public health interventions at general population level are imperative in order to decrease the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), but they may contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. our results support the negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of the brazilian population. the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our sample indicates that the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic should be considered a public health problem in brazil. it is therefore believed that they might exacerbate mental illness in patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, resulting in poor adherence and response to antiviral treatment. the sars-cov-2 (covid-19) pandemic poses immense challenges for national and international healthcare systems. the covid pandemic is now leading to the emergence of a secondary mental health pandemic. 
No theoretical reason to believe COVID vaccine will cause harm to pregnant mothers or unborn child. https://t.co/xHtWkeGhKb [SEP] killed oral cholera vaccines (ocv) are not recommended for pregnant women though there is no evidence of harmful effects during pregnancy. we evaluated adverse pregnancy outcome (spontaneous miscarriages, still births, or congenital malformations) between those who were exposed to ocv and those who were not exposed to ocv. about 16% of pregnant women exposed to ocv had pregnancy loss, as compared to 12% of unvaccinated pregnant women (p=0.38). campaigns avoid giving vaccine to pregnant women because of the absence of safety data of the killed whole-cell oral cholera (rbs-wc) vaccine. balancing this concern is the known higher risk of cholera and of complications of pregnancy should cholera occur in these women, as well as the lack of expected adverse events from a killed oral bacterial vaccine. we found no statistically significant evidence of a harmful effect of gestational exposure to the rbs-wc vaccine. in the absence of circulating smallpox, pregnant women should not be exposed to live vaccinia virus contained in the smallpox vaccine. several studies investigating potential adverse effects of the pandemic a(h1n1) vaccine have supported that influenza a(h1n1) vaccination does not increase the risk for major pregnancy and birth adverse outcomes, but little is known about possible adverse effects in offspring of a(h1n1)-vaccinated mothers beyond the perinatal period and into early childhood. to evaluate whether pandemic influenza a(h1n1) vaccination in pregnancy increases the risk for early childhood morbidity in offspring. these results support the safety profile of the influenza a(h1n1) vaccine used in pregnancy. 
 Even Fauci the Gates mouthpiece admits masks do not protect you. Btw corona can get in your eyes, through cloth, on your clothes etc. The mask can recirculate bacteria in your body, affect your immune system, double your co2 intake, cause lung infections etc. Individual choice. [SEP] very little is known concerning the effect of respirator masks on maximal oxygen consumption (vo2max) and the lactate threshold (lt). face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. centrifugation-based filtration efficiency test not only compensates shortcomings of current tests for masks, but also offers a simple way to explore new mask materials during pandemics. common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission. the common chemical warfare protective masks impose an excessive respiratory load on the wearer due to elevated breathing resistance and increased dead space. besides, the substantial negative pressure created within the mask during inspiration may result in an inward leakage in individuals having difficulties with proper facial fitting of the mask. however, such gas masks would not protect patients on home mechanical ventilation, as ventilator airflow would bypass the cbrn filter. respiratory masks are used to deliver non-invasive ventilation for cardiorespiratory pathologies. many athletes avoid using mouthguards because they believe that they impair their ability to breath and negatively affect performance. recently, some manufacturers have developed "vented" mouthguards (ventmgs) to address this concern. 
  All vaccines have side effects and in a small % of cases even cause death  The chances of getting/dying from polio were higher than from the Vaccine. So it made sense to take the jab  When it comes to Covid, more children will be hospitalised/die from the vaccine than from Covid [SEP] infections are still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age, most of which can be prevented by vaccination. injections of vaccines provoked paralytic poliomyelitis in children in the uk and elsewhere. vaccination against smallpox may result in a variety of complications, ranging in severity from benign to lethal. because side effects occur most often in first-time vaccinees, current plans for rapid large-scale vaccination in the event of bioterrorist attack raise concerns about the occurrence of a large number of adverse events. the risk of paralytic disease was strongly associated with injections given after the oral polio virus vaccine, but not with injections given before or at the same time as the vaccine (matched odds ratio, 56.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 8.9 to infinity). the attributable risk in the population for intramuscular injections given in the 30 days before the onset of paralysis was 86 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 66 to 95 percent); that is, we estimate that 86 percent of the cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in this population might have been prevented by the elimination of intramuscular injections within 30 days after exposure to oral poliovirus vaccine. this study examines whether children who had the live-attenuated oral polio vaccine (opv) as the most recent vaccine had a different rate of admissions for infectious diseases than children with inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (dtap-ipv-hib) or live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (mmr) as their most recent vaccine. oral polio vaccine was associated with a lower rate of admissions with any type of non-polio infection compared with dtap-ipv-hib as most recent vaccine (adjusted incidence rate ratio [irr], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [ci], .77-.95). oral poliovirus vaccine has eliminated paralytic poliomyelitis caused by polioviruses in many temperate-climate countries in which a large proportion of children remain unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. this live viral vaccine has a wider array of rare but serious medical side effects (eg, eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, encephalitis, myopericarditis) compared with other vaccines that are given currently to the public. 
 They already know for non-rna vaxs that Linked Epitope Suppression will likely cause Most Severe infection for subsequent exposure to Covid after vax (Aka Pathogenic Priming) same as seen wi Dengue vaccine.  They also know that novel RNA/DNA vaxs are likely to spike autoimmunity. [SEP] prospective covid-19 vaccines presenting α-gal epitopes may provide better protection than vaccines lacking this epitope because of increased uptake by apc. vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic covid-19 and previously emerging mers/sars caused by coronavirus (cov) infections. the cov spike receptor-binding domain (rbd) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. coronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (mers-cov) cause high case fatality rates and remain major human public health threats, creating a need for effective vaccines. while coronavirus antigens that induce protective neutralizing antibodies have been identified, coronavirus vaccines present a unique problem in that immunized individuals when infected by virus can develop lung eosinophilic pathology, a problem that is further exacerbated by the formulation of sars-cov vaccines with alum adjuvants. the results lay the groundwork for a new type of covid-19 diagnostic for the early prediction of disease severity to guide more effective therapeutic interventions. antibodies targeting a specific location within a sars-cov-2 structural protein are linked to poor covid-19 disease outcomes. the possibility of new vaccinia immunizations in the event of a bioterror-related smallpox release poses an additional negative impact on the utility of vaccinia-based vectors. importantly, we found that vaccination with a b5r deletion virus, followed by boosting with the gag-expressing virus lacking the majority of the b5 ectodomain, resulted in poorer anti-gag immune responses. coronaviruses (cov) cause common colds in humans, but are also responsible for the recent severe acute, and middle east, respiratory syndromes (sars and mers, respectively). 
23. The claim that only (severe) #Covid_19 but not influenza may cause venous thrombosis and pulmonary (lung) embolism is not true, as it has been known for 50 years that severe influenza greatly increases the risk of thrombosis and embolism, too. [SEP] severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is known to be associated with a heightened risk of thromboembolism. the most dreaded thoracic complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are acute pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis. introduction while coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mostly causes respiratory illnesses, emerging evidence has shown that patients with severe covid-19 can develop complications like venous thromboembolism (vte) and arterial thrombosis as well. venous thromboembolism (vte) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) are frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complications among hospitalized patients of covid-19 infection. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) could predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism, in an exaggerated immune response to the virus, especially in severe patients. venous thromboembolism is a common manifestation in hospitalized patients with covid-19 with a reported incidence that is significantly higher compared to other acute viral infections. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the respiratory system, but it may cause cardiovascular complications such as thromboembolism. rarely, pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with severe covid-19 infection, especially in intensive care units. ct pulmonary angiography and chest ct scans revealed acute massive embolism and typical imaging findings of covid-19 pneumonia, respectively. covid-19 infection appears to induce venous thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism. 
A CDC panel says administering Johnson & Johnson shots would save many lives. It could cause about 24 cases of a rare and dangerous clotting disorder, but prevent 1,435 COVID-19 deaths, a CDC staffer and an analysis suggested. https://t.co/k49KoeeWfB [SEP] if, as is alleged, challenge trials of vaccines against covid-19 are likely to save thousands of lives and vastly diminish the economic and social harms of the pandemic while subjecting volunteers to risks that are comparable to kidney donation, then it would seem that the only sensible objection to such trials would be to deny that they have low risks or can be expected to have immense benefits. nevertheless, this phenomenon can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with covid-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. recent studies showed that glucocorticoid drugs, which are easily available as pills on pharmacy shelves worldwide, could save lives of covid-19 patients. with the swiftly increasing infections of the sars-cov-2 pandemic at a lethality rate of about 4.7% countless lives may be saved globally. we sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (hcq) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill covid-19 patients. these data demonstrate that addition of hcq on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of covid-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. therefore, hcq should be prescribed as a part of treatment for critically ill covid-19 patients, with possible outcome of saving lives. efforts directed toward alleviating prehospital combat trauma death, known as killed in action (kia) mortality, have the greatest opportunity for eliminating preventable death. reduction in kia mortality is associated with early treatment capabilities, blunt mechanism, select body locations of injury, and rapid transport. this dissemination can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with covid-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. 
    Exactly but its daft to put yourself in a position where in future life you could be classed as having a chronic illness  from a virus which is highly likely to cause some damage which would put you in a high risk category. you have the chance to protect yourself. Up to you !!! [SEP] some chronic diseases predispose to a severe course of the disease and increase the risk of complications and death. staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus and consequently being largely inactive is associated with unintended consequences. this review aims to provide practical guidelines during the covid-19 quarantine period. in order to provide prophylactic prevention from the emerging and re-emerging viruses, vaccine is suggested as the most efficient way to prevent individuals from the threat of viral infection. vaccination is the most efficient approach to prevent the spreading of viral infection and promote individual and public health. the notion of risk underlying the concept of vulnerability implies that everyone is potentially vulnerable (or at risk), that is, there is always a chance of developing health problems. a virus may manifest directly as a contagious disease with a clinical pathology of varying significance. on the other hand, viruses may provide hope: hope for an efficacious treatment of serious disease. therefore, particular consideration is needed to protect the cardiovascular system during this pandemic. understanding immune responses to viral infections is crucial to progress in the quest for effective infection prevention and control. 
It’s still unknown how the vaccine could cause blood clots. One potential explanation is that some people develop an immune response that attacks platelets, making them clump together, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine tied to uncommon blood clots, experts.  https://t.co/peLyu8wX25 [SEP] while coronavirus (covid-19) is not transfusion-transmitted, the impact of the global pandemic on blood services worldwide is complex. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is associated with high incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events. immature platelets represent a population of hyper-reactive platelets associated with arterial events. patients with covid-19 have increased immature platelets indices compared to stable patients with cardiovascular risk factors, and as the disease progresses also compared to ami patients. the enhanced platelet turnover and reactivity may have a role in the development of thrombotic events in covid-19 patients. critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have been observed to be hypercoagulable, but the mechanisms for this remain poorly described. in view of non-availability of suitable vaccine for prevention or no established definitive therapy for sars-cov-2, plasma therapy is gaining importance in a current pandemic as one of the treatment options for the treatment of covid-19. clotting factor concentrates prepared from human plasma are a potential route of parvovirus b19 (b19) infection in patients with coagulation disorders. the presence of b19 parvovirus in plasma from blood donors is seldom demonstrable, but clotting factor concentrates, prepared from large plasma pools, may be able to transmit b19 virus infection, and the effectiveness of different chemical and physical treatment to inactivate this virus is not yet known. although a risk of transfusion-transmitted human parvovirus b19v (tt-b19v) infection has been a concern, there have been very few reports of clinically relevant tt-b19v caused by the transfusion of a b19v-containing blood component. 
 Truly sorry to hear for your loss. However, the vaccination is NOT safe. It will not save you and will cause problems to your body. FDA has not yet approved any of Covid vaccines but said can be used for emergency purposes. There is a big difference. I do not trust the vaccine. [SEP] however, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. we characterized the immunogenicity of modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva), one of the more promising alternative smallpox vaccines, in a cohort of 10 chronically hiv-1-infected individuals undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). the observed immune responses suggest that the highly attenuated mva could be used as a substitute vaccine against smallpox in chronically hiv-1-infected individuals undergoing haart. the current live vaccinia virus vaccine used in the prevention of smallpox is contraindicated for millions of immune-compromised individuals. although vaccination with the current smallpox vaccine produces protective immunity, it might result in mild to serious health complications for some vaccinees. the focus of this review article is to open this black box and provide a conceptual framework for how vaccine safety is traditionally assessed. the existing, licensed vaccines based on live vaccinia virus (vacv) are contraindicated for a substantial number of people, and prophylactic vaccination of large populations is not reasonable when there is little risk of exposure. the administration of vaccines is not usually recommended in pregnant women because of a fear of severe adverse events for the fetus. however, contraindication to vaccination applies only to vaccines based on live attenuated viruses for the theoretical possibility that they might infect the fetus. vaccines remain an effective yet controversial method for preventing infectious diseases like those caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) and pandemic influenza (h1n1). 
    COVID attacks the lungs which causes inflammation, especially with people suffering from NCD's. The body responds to inflammation with a cykotine response, which causes, and I quote, significant changes in motor activity and motivation as well as anxiety, arousal, and alarm" [SEP] relatively little is understood about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the changes in neuronal control of the respiratory tract during viral infection, but the evidence supports the idea that changes occur in the physiology of both the sensory and autonomic innervation. in addition, respiratory viral infections are associated with changes in the control of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic nerve endings terminating at the level of the airway smooth muscle. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), a progressive lung disease characterized by sustained neutrophilic airway inflammation, is caused by chronic exposure to noxious stimuli, e.g., cigarette smoke. copd exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinflation. they are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with an inflammatory response that becomes more pronounced in acute exacerbations. these heterogeneous events follow increased airway inflammation, often due to infection, and lead to decreased airflow and increased lung hyperinflation relative to stable copd. we recently demonstrated enhanced activity and sensitivity of the carotid chemoreceptor (cc) in copd which may alter ventilatory and cardiovascular regulation and negatively affect exercise tolerance. we sought to determine whether cc inhibition improves ventilatory and cardiovascular regulation, dyspnea and exercise tolerance in copd. these data suggest that the cc plays a role in cardiovascular regulation during exercise in copd; however, ventilation, dyspnea and exercise tolerance were unaffected by cc inhibition in copd patients. 
 Yes, I'm doing the same, watching other countries. I have a rare autoimmune disease + take various immunosuppressants as my body is always fighting its own immune system. Understanding how Covid19 can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response resulting in a Cytokine storm /... [SEP] the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic is a threat of particular concern for people affected by chronic immune-mediated diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (ms), who are often treated with immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs, which may increase the risk of infections in general. here we will review available information on how infections by human coronaviruses affect the immune system in untreated subjects and in patients affected by ms treated with drugs which modulate the immune system. the ongoing coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic is a global health emergency of international concern and has affected management plans of many autoimmune disorders. the covid-19 pandemic has raised questions about the management of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for rheumatic conditions. the content used in this paper has been taken from english language articles (2005-2020) retrieved from the pubmed database and google scholar search engine using "covid-19," "autoimmune disease," "therapeutic," "pathogenesis," and "pathway" keywords. the emergence of covid-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. due to the common pathogenesis of covid-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus. individuals maintained on immunosuppression appear to be especially susceptible to covid-19 infection. we investigated the incidence of covid-19 and the impact of immunosuppression and containment measures on the risk of sars-cov-2 infection in a large ibd cohort, from a multicenter cohort from 21st of february to 30th of june, 2020. covid-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. 
  Pneumonia and bronchitis are inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria or viruses, including the virus which causes COVID. So your statement really doesn't make much sense as pneumonia and bronchitis are both possible symptoms of COVID. [SEP] it has been hypothesized that covid-19 lung involvement could represent not only a viral effect but also an immune response induced by the infection, causing epithelial/endothelial lesions and coagulation disorders. pneumonia appears to be the most common manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but some extrapulmonary involvement, such as gastrointestinal, cardiac and renal, has been reported. the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has resulted in a global pandemic, with the main manifestations being of respiratory nature, including pneumonia. several studies have been published describing the clinical and radiographic findings of coronavirus disease 2019-related pneumonia. respiratory viral infection causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations. the virus-induced inflammatory cells in patients with copd were positively associated with virus load, illness severity, and reductions in lung function. covid-19 disease caused by infection with the sars-cov-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ards), multi-organ failure and death. viral infections could be an important cause of acute exacerbations of copd (aecopd) and only a few studies report the prevalence of respiratory viruses on this disease. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), manifested as emphysema and chronic airway obstruction, can be exacerbated by bacterial and viral infections. in covid-19, lung manifestations present as a slowly evolving pneumonia with insidious early onset interstitial pulmonary edema that undergoes acute exacerbation in the late stages and microvascular thrombosis. 
Covid-19 vaccines initiates an early and progressive clotting of blood in the lungs (pulmonary thrombosis) which impairs blood supply and gas exchange at lungs, leading to respiratory failure, which in majority of cases cause death. [SEP] patients affected by severe coronavirus induced disease-2019 (covid-19) often experience hypoxemia due to alveolar involvement and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the formation of micro thrombi in the pulmonary capillary vessels. covid-19 disease is a viral illness that predominantly causes pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. covid-19 can cause multiple organ dysfunction, such as respiratory and circulatory failure, liver and kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolism, and even death. covid-19 derives from infection with coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov-2] and is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thrombogenic agents resulting in destruction of the lungs. patients with coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions, while lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. fulminant thrombotic complications emerge as critical issues in patients with severe covid-19. the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the resulting disease covid-19 causes pulmonary failure including severe courses requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (v-v ecmo). coagulopathy is a known complication of covid-19 leading to thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) as a respiratory tract infection has been noted to be a causative agent for acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and multiple organ failure. we describe a case of severe arterial thrombosis induced by covid-19 infection along with its pathological implications. 
Up to half of hospitalized COVID patients have elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, or antibodies that cause blood clots to form. Patients with these antibodies are much more likely to have severe respiratory disease and kidney injury. #COVID19 [SEP] critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. as observed in other infections with a systemic inflammatory response, severe covid-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and a prothrombotic state. currently, there is growing evidence that pulmonary embolism and thrombosis contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in critically ill patients with covid-19. covid-19 is an infection induced by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) requiring intensive care unit (icu) management. covid-19 is frequently accompanied by a hypercoagulable inflammatory state with microangiopathic pulmonary changes that can precede the diffuse alveolar damage characteristic of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) seen in other severe pathogenic infections. fatal covid-19 has been associated with a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by a pro-coagulant state and organ damage, particularly microvascular thrombi in the lungs and kidneys. these findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with covid-19 become at least transiently positive for apl antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic. emerging evidence points to an association between severe clinical presentation of covid-19 and increased risk of thromboembolism. severe covid-19 illness is associated with intense inflammation, leading to high rates of thrombotic complications that increase morbidity and mortality. 
   Along those same lines, if my loved one dies straight after getting a covid vaccination, can I get the hospital to state the cause of death was the vaccine?  If it's good for COVID then it must be good for the vaccines as well?   #COVID19Aus #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine #uspol [SEP] the availability of a covid-19 vaccine is being heralded as the solution to control the current covid-19 pandemic, reduce the number of infections and deaths and facilitate resumption of our previous way of life. ensuring public confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness will be crucial to facilitate uptake. in this article, the authors discuss the expedited vaccine development process for covid-19 vaccines; the likely vaccine prioritisation schedule and anticipated key target groups; the behavioural and social drivers of vaccination acceptance, including the work required to facilitate this; and the implications for general practice. whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. here, we assess this possibility from an ethical point of view, by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices. however, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value ​​a vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. specific antibodies were measured with elisa, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with sars-cov-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. we recommend clinical studies to validate afo-202 beta glucan in covid-19 patients to prove its efficacy in overcoming a hyper-inflammation status, thus reducing the mortality, until a definite vaccine is made available. several nations have indicated that if there is a compelling case for use of a vaccine before it is licensed, they would be prepared to authorise its emergency use or conditional approval on public health grounds. 
Chronic stress could cause problems for your baby. These can include effects on your unborn baby’s growth and the length of gestation.[NEWLINE]#healthdisparities #blacklivesmatter #covid #publichealth #health #socialdeterminantsofhealth #healthequity https://t.co/4JgSKue9tQ [SEP] stress-induced pregnancy complications represent a significant cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality due to preterm labor, low-birth-weight babies, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and neuropsychological developmental delays of affected offspring. maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy can adversely influence child development, but few studies have investigated psychosocial stress during the postpartum period and its association with risk of toddler developmental delays. maternal postpartum stress may contribute to increased risk for developmental delays and is an important target for psychosocial intervention. the high levels of stress evidenced at all pregnancy stages indicate that many of these women are experiencing chronic stress, which can contribute to higher black maternal morbidity and mortality rates, and possibly infant mortality rates. psychological distress during pregnancy has been shown to perturb the delicate physiological milieu of pregnancy, and has been associated with negative repercussions in the offspring, including adverse birth outcomes, long-term defects in cognitive development, behavioral problems during childhood and high baseline levels of stress-related hormones. given the potential long-term effects of early-life stress on a child's health, it is crucial to minimize maternal distress during pregnancy. postpartum stress has been shown to have an association with infant growth, nutrition, bonding, temperament and ultimately childhood mental wellbeing. when persistent, recurring or chronic, it can negatively impact infant outcome, including the subscales of mental wellbeing such as growth, development, feeding, attachment and sleep. postpartum stress is negatively associated with poor developmental trajectories and linear growth deficits, causing stunting in growth; poor language and cognitive development; poor gross and fine motor movement, and infant sleep. premature birth has been associated with a number of adverse maternal psychological outcomes that include depression, anxiety, and trauma as well as adverse effects on maternal coping ability and parenting style. 
 I've heard heart disease and cancer death tolls down 50-60% because if patient tested positive for Covid 19, Covid 19 was reported as their cause of death.  Is this true? [SEP] hypertension, diabetes and heart disease are the most common comorbidities in patients with covid-19. the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of patients with comorbidities who died of covid-19 in brazil. there is a high prevalence of comorbidities (83%) among patients who died from covid-19 in brazil, with heart disease being the most prevalent. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since december 2019. to explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with covid-19. cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has led to a large increase in mortality in the united states and around the world, leaving many grieving the sudden loss of family members. the aim of current study is evaluating the prevalence of underlying disease in died people with covid-19. the crude mortality rate in critical pneumonia cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) reaches 49%. the high mortality observed in covid-19 patients may be related to unrecognized pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis, or other underlying cardiovascular diseases. 
Fact: The COVID-19 vaccine will NOT give you #COVID19. None of the vaccines currently in development or use in the U.S. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. But, as the #vaccine helps you build #immunity, the process can sometimes cause symptoms, such as a fever. https://t.co/SJV4eGWDAj [SEP] a new coronavirus infection, covid-19, has recently emerged, and has caused a global pandemic along with an international public health emergency. currently, no licensed vaccines are available for covid-19. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. these principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. present hopes to conquer the covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its associated impacts on health and society, covid-19 vaccines are essential. the u.s. government is working to produce and deliver safe and effective covid-19 vaccines for the entire u.s. population. covid-19 is a contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the extensive efforts around the globe are being made to develop a suitable vaccine against covid-19 (coronavirus disease-19) caused by sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2). at the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a covid-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. 
     Let's all get one thing straight:  The virus in question is a beta-coronavirus called SARS-COV-2. It itself is a variant of SARS-COV, and related to MERS-COV.  The virus is claimed to cause a recognized (yet disputed) list of symptoms. This list is known as COVID-19. [SEP] severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the causative agent of the covid19 pandemic, is a highly pathogenic β-coronavirus. the illness caused by sars cov-2 is referred to as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is an emerging coronavirus that belongs to the β-genus, causing the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19). the new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of β-coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of sars-cov, the causative agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004. severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), is a member of the coronavirus family. the recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus is pathogenic and a highly transmittable viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). sars-cov-2 is the coronavirus agent of the covid-19 pandemic causing high mortalities. sars-cov-2 is the coronavirus agent of the covid-19 pandemic causing high mortalities. nowadays, the appearance of a new, highly pathogenic and lethal coronavirus variant, sars-cov-2, responsible for a pandemic (covid-19), represents a global problem for human health. 
“Patients brought into hospital with heart attack symptoms have later been found to be suffering from cardiac inflammation caused by the virus...it can begin as a kidney infection, or as meningitis, before going on to cause respiratory problems.” #COVID19  https://t.co/tlVDUjp8Q8 [SEP] as the coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic marches unrelentingly, more patients with cardiac arrhythmias are emerging due to the effects of the virus on the respiratory and cardiovascular (cv) systems and the systemic inflammation that it incurs, and also as a result of the proarrhythmic effects of covid-19 pharmacotherapies and other drug interactions and the associated autonomic imbalance that enhance arrhythmogenicity. we present the case of a 56-year-old male admitted with covid-19 fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. severe myocarditis and heart failure have both been reported as the initial presenting conditions in covid-19 infection. in the throes of the current coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. to describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. this case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for covid-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in march 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to covid-19. cardiac involvement with covid-19. this case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with covid-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been reported as the possible cause of acute myocarditis. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19), a respiratory disease has been associated with ischemic complications, coagulation disorders, and an endotheliitis. 
 Polio vaccine underwent the largest clinical trial for its time.  COVID passed through the EUA process.   Science is telling us two of the vaccines cause blood clots.  People are allowed to make logical judgements on what they do or dont put in their body. [SEP] covid-19 has become a global pandemic, and an effective vaccine is needed. vaccines are a powerful measure to protect the health of individuals and to combat outbreaks such as the covid-19 pandemic. an ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. this essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. in the hiv vaccine trials network (hvtn) 111 trial, we compared safety and immunogenicity of dna prime followed by dna/protein boost with dna/protein co-administration injected intramuscularly via either needle/syringe or a needle-free injection device (biojector). vaccines to prevent pv infection, utilising pv l1 virus like particles (vlps) to induce neutralising antibody, are in clinical trial and show all the characteristics likely to be associated with success. an efficacious covid-19 vaccine is currently the world's leading research priority. covid-19 poses an extraordinary threat to global public health and an effective vaccine could provide a key means of overcoming this crisis. in this paper we present an overview of the literature on efficacy and safety trials of the various pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on the market (pcv7) and in development (pcv9, pcv11 and allegedly pcv10 and pcv13), as well as of observations from post-licensure studies. pcvs are generally very well tolerated and safe, also when co-administered with other childhood vaccines. 
I know no system is perfect, so I share this with that in mind - Getting #COVID in #EmergencyRooms - I found only one small study that says low risk.  More #research needs to be done, as this was the cause in my family! [NEWLINE]I beg to differ! [NEWLINE]https://t.co/HEeEWQyH75 https://t.co/AXWgzLhwWD [SEP] i offer a critical perspective on a large-scale population study on gene-environment interactions and common diseases proposed by the us secretary of health and human services' advisory committee on genetics, health, and society (sacghs). i argue that for scientific and policy reasons this and similar studies have little to add to current knowledge about how to prevent, treat, or decrease inequalities in common diseases, all of which are major claims of the proposal. corrosive ingestion is thoroughly investigated in terms of its complications and treatment modalities but to date family functioning, behavior, attitude and knowledge of mothers of children who ingested corrosives has not been investigated and socio-demographic data has rarely been mentioned. however, results are not always consistent with each other, and relevant recommendations concerning prevention thus cannot be given before more studies with larger populations are conducted to confirm or refute the findings reviewed. family-centered care seems promising in preventive pediatrics, but evidence is lacking as to whether this type of care is also valid as a means to identify risks to infants' social-emotional development. scores on gold standards were significantly higher when pch assessments were rated as "at risk" (overall and per domain).we found reasonable to excellent agreement regarding the absence of risk factors (negative agreement rate: 0.40-0.98), but lower agreement regarding the presence of risk factors (positive agreement rate: 0.00-0.67). agreement was reasonable to excellent regarding protective factors, but lower regarding risk factors. because systematic reviews made clear that there is substantial uncertainty about management, i looked for information about relevant, well-designed controlled trials in which i might be able to participate as a patient. my experiences illustrate why i believe better information systems are needed if clinical research is to become integrated in everyday clinical practice, for the benefit of both patients and clinicians. (international standardized randomized controlled trial number register: isrctn 17943542). 
   The 10,000 deaths are those caused by Covid alone, excluding anyone who may have had cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure or any other number of preexisting conditions.  The 200,000 is a real number that is still climbing.  Time to re-educate yourself. [SEP] carcinomas of the uterine cervix and corpus are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among women in the u.s. and are expected to contribute 10,700 deaths in 2002. for the united states, vsl is estimated as approximately $10 million, which implies the value of preventing 100,000 covid-19 deaths is $1 trillion. causes of death classified by the international classification of diseases, tenth revision (icd-10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. in 2002, the 10 leading causes of death were (in rank order) diseases of heart; malignant neoplasms; cerebrovascular diseases; chronic lower respiratory diseases; accidents (unintentional injuries); diabetes mellitus; influenza and pneumonia; alzheimer's disease; nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; and septicemia and accounted for about 79 percent of all deaths occurring in the united states. this report presents final 1999 data on the 10 leading causes of death in the united states by age, race, sex, and hispanic origin. causes of death classified by the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision (icd-10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. in 1999 the 10 leading causes of death were (in rank order) diseases of heart; malignant neoplasms; cerebrovascular diseases; chronic lower respiratory diseases; accidents; diabetes mellitus; influenza and pneumonia; alzheimer's disease; nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis; and septicemia and accounted for nearly 80 percent of all deaths occurring in the united states. cardiovascular disease (cvd) is the leading cause of death in the u.s. state-specific predicted 10-year risk of developing cvd could provide useful information for state health planning and policy. the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) has threatened health worldwide. as of the end of 2020, there were nearly 10 million confirmed cases and nearly 5 million deaths associated with covid-19. 
In a few decades there's gonna be a section in history books about the #pandemicbabies that caused a spike in the population similar to the #babyboomers after ww2. #pandemic #COVID19 #coronavirus #StayHome #Quarantine [SEP] the year 2020 will infamously be known for the covid-19 pandemic. unfortunately, this pandemic is expected to make a resurgence in the fall, but hopefully more will be known about sars-cov-2, better treatment protocols will be established, and, possibly, a safe and effective vaccine will be developed and available soon. the year 2020 was ushered in with a historical novel virus (covid-19) pandemic in a manner that the world has never witnessed before. the novel coronavirus, also known as covid-19, has moved rapidly across the world in 2020. this article reports on the recent consequences of the pandemic for early childhood education in sweden, norway, and the united states. the authors illustrate the effects of the pandemic on preschools in their countries, against a backdrop of frequent changes in infection and mortality rates, epidemiological understandings, government strategies, and mitigation strategies regarding preschool closures. ideas about future preparedness for such pandemics are also discussed. the world is confronted by the current pandemic of corona virus disease (covid-19), which is a wake-up call for all nations irrespective of their development status or geographical location. the situation of crisis produced by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic poses major challenges to societies all over the world. since the beginning of the year, the world's attention has rightly been focused on the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and the implementation of drastic mitigation strategies to limit disease transmission. 
Stop calling it a vaccine!! Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick. Covid shot doesnt [SEP] many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and diphtheria) are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs. vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. to be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. we propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). in an era that emphasizes the term "cost-effective," vaccines are the ideal solution to preventing disease at a relatively low cost to society. vaccines are responsible for the control of many infectious diseases that were once common in the united states, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (german measles), mumps, tetanus, and haemophilus influenzae type b. however, despite the reduced number of cases of and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases such as pertussis and measles, outbreaks continue to occur as more parents fail to adequately vaccinate their children because of misinformation about immunizations. immunization strategies for the elderly are frequently perceived as comprising only vaccines against influenza, streptococcus pneumoniae, and herpes zoster. conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are a recent intervention to combat the relative inability of young children to mount an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, especially haemophilus influenzae (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp). 
   Btw- it’s driving me bonkers that people are acting like the pandemic is over.. variants, how long the vaccine is effective is concerning, breakthrough cases in the vaccinated. Even Asymptotic covid can cause long term problems! [SEP] drawing on these cases, and an adaptation of an epidemiological modeling of the spread of ideas, we propose that vaccine hesitancy can be grouped into two categories: 'baseline' and 'reactive' vaccine hesitancy. modeling the diffusion of (mis)information during vaccine hesitancy 'outbreaks' is essential for designing interventions that will ensure appropriate management of 'reactive' hesitancy, and control of 'baseline' levels of vaccine hesitancy. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, with the united states being highly affected. a vaccine provides the best hope for a permanent solution to controlling the pandemic. prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards covid-19 vaccination. approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for covid-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. a significant portion of the u.s. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new covid-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. while vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. and if confidence falters, vaccine coverage dips, and an outbreak of measles, mumps, or rubella ensues, who, if anyone, will stand and say "i misled them, i confused them, this is my responsibility"? 
   Getting Covid causes your body to make antibodies against the virus (probably more than one type).  The vaccine cause the body to make one very specific antibody.  This mixed immunity is probably very good [SEP] immunogenicity of inactivated virus or subviral vaccines may be enhanced by complexing with an igg antibody. adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of highly purified antigens that have insufficient immunostimulatory capabilities, and have been used in human vaccines for more than 90 years. while early adjuvants (aluminum, oil-in-water emulsions) were used empirically, rapidly increasing knowledge on how the immune system interacts with pathogens means that there is increased understanding of the role of adjuvants and how the formulation of modern vaccines can be better tailored towards the desired clinical benefit. thus, the right match of antigens and adjuvants can potentiate downstream adaptive immune responses, enabling the development of new efficacious vaccines. the antibody response elicited after immunization with vaccinia virus (vacv) is known to be sufficient to confer host protection against vacv or smallpox. vaccines have been used almost exclusively to prevent or control infectious diseases with the aim of long-lasting immunity. immune responses to the capsular polysaccharide administered in the polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines can be either improved or suppressed by the pre-existence of immunity to the carrier protein. receiving multiple vaccinations is essential for travellers such as hajj pilgrims, and the use of conjugated vaccines is recommended. vaccine materials include antigens of pathogens and adjuvants potentiating the effectiveness of vaccination. this review summarizes recent developments in mucosal vaccines and their associated adjuvants. 
   No you cannot get sticker from wearing your mask. It says that if you have moderate to severe asthma that covid-19 can exacerbate things and possibly cause pneumonia [SEP] patients with copd have an increased risk for severe covid-19. symptoms such as high-grade fever, anorexia, and myalgia may distinguish covid-19 from dyspnea due to a copd-related exacerbation. patients with copd and covid-19 infection who treat their illness at home should self-isolate, use nebulizers with precautions to avoid viral aerosolization, and frequently disinfect room surfaces. the centers for disease control and prevention advises that patients with moderate to severe asthma belong to a high-risk group that is susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). however, the association between asthma and covid-19 has not been well-established. the primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among patients with covid-19 in a major us health system. we assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients with covid-19. despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our covid-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. background: covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by an invasion of the alveolar epithelial cells by coronavirus 19. with the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the amount of used personal protective equipment (ppe) including face masks and protective clothes has significantly increased. 
    Zitat aus obigem Artikel: „But there’s no evidence currently that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune disease or make it worse... . At the moment there’s every reason to suggest that people with autoimmune diseases ought to get either of these vaccines when they get rolled out.”“ [SEP] such causation has been claimed based mainly on case reports and uncontrolled studies, and a syndrome 'autoimmune/autoinflammatory disorder induced by adjuvants' (asia) has been claimed to be linked to immunization, particularly hepatitis b vaccination. overall no association between hepatitis b vaccination and the onset of autoimmune diseases was seen. only one study showed a significant excess risk between hepatitis b immunisation and autoimmune disease. despite multiple case reports, there is no reliable scientific evidence of autoimmune diseases being caused by hepatitis b vaccinations. the induction or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases is a potential adverse effect of immunostimulating drugs. epidemiological studies, however, have so far failed to demonstrate any causal relationship between vaccination and autoimmune diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). the vaccine is contraindicated in individuals taking anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-tnf) therapies or other biologics commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases because of the safety concern that zoster vaccine may be associated with a short-term hz risk. the concern that immunizations may lead to the development of autoimmune disease (aid) has been questioned. although most adverse effects attributed to vaccines are mild, rare reactions such as autoimmunity do occur. the potential for development of autoimmune diseases after vaccination with new vaccines containing novel adjuvants is a theoretical concern. 
  If it's unclear it can't be reported.  The death has to be contributed from Covid because Covid causes the respiratory issues etc that cause the death, Covid caused it.  Like lung cancer if death because their lung stopped functioning because of cancer they died from lung cancer. [SEP] this study concerns the clinicopathologic correlation of 50 decedents of 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) from among 250 reported patients succumbing to covid-19 illness (1-7) who underwent detailed postmortem neuropathological studies. the high mortality observed in covid-19 patients may be related to unrecognized pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis, or other underlying cardiovascular diseases. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is characterized by inflammation of the lungs with increasing respiratory impairment. the cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). health authorities and decision makers should be guided by reliable estimates of mortality and of the proportion of infected people who die from sars-cov-2 virus infection. progressive respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from covid-19. we examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) secondary to influenza a(h1n1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. in patients who died from covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular t-cell infiltration.

   Many of the covid vaccines are more likely to cause side effects compared to your normal flu shot. Here is the data for 1st and 2nd doses.   Side effects don't mean it's bad for you. It means it's working. That's how the immune system works.  Source:  https://t.co/hFv7q9slPh https://t.co/2LjZ6lXmrV [SEP] "bad side effects" and "do not like shots" were major reasons given for not receiving influenza vaccine. we aimed to study the effect of seasonal influenza (flu) vaccination on the susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. a prior covid-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (1.05-1.11)), fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like illness (1.78 (1.51-2.10)), fatigue (1.34 (1.20-1.49)) and local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)). while mrna vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 (1.01-1.11)) compared with viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p < 0.001), mostly local reactions. importantly, mrna vaccine recipients reported a considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (rr < 0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 (0.31-0.58)). our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (rcts) demonstrating that covid-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. for the first time, our study links prior covid-19 illness with an increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mrna vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects but more local reactions. adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. the most common symptoms were injection site pain, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and tiredness. 
 The S1 spike protein used in the Covid vaccine may be toxic to endothelial cells. Likely the cause of the clotting problems we are seeing from people who get the vaccine.  https://t.co/ZCepuEfWCD [SEP] severe covid-19 is often accompanied by coagulopathies such as thrombocytopenia and abnormal clotting. rarely, such complications follow sars-cov-2 vaccination. it is hypothesized that coagulopathies accompanying sars-cov-2 infections and vaccinations result from bacterial co-infections that synergize with virus-induced autoimmunity due to antigenic mimicry of blood proteins by both bacterial and viral antigens. the novel combination of a dna vaccine encoding the full-length spike (s) protein of sars-cov-2 and a recombinant s1 protein vaccine induced high level neutralizing antibody and t cell immune responses in both small and large animal models. thus, sars-cov-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat covid-19. thus, sars-cov-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat covid-19. background it is unknown if the efficacy of the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) vaccine is affected by the co-administration of other vaccines. it is concluded that ace2+ endothelial damage is a central part of sars-cov2 pathology and may be induced by the spike protein alone. the covid-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid production of vaccines aimed at the production of neutralizing antibodies against the covid-19 spike protein required for the corona virus binding to target cells. one paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. 
  And the Covid vaccine can’t knock out all the variants either.   So once again, we are taking a vaccine with known risks that STILL doesn’t let us leave our basements or take off our double masks. But it does cause blood clots, so there’s that. [SEP] moreover, covid-19 vaccination against sars-cov-2 is not 100% guaranteed, as new variants arise due to mutations. in conclusion, factors leading to the eradication of sars-cov-2 from the world are complex to be achieved, so the exploration of covid-19 vaccination and people's attitude toward protective countermeasures may provide insights for policymakers to encourage vaccinated people to follow protective health measures and help in completely defeating the covid-19 from the globe. although the control of covid-19 largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage, and community lockdowns) initially, three safe and highly-effective vaccines (by astrazeneca inc., moderna inc., and pfizer inc.), were approved for use in humans in december 2020. safe and effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) provide the best opportunity to control the pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to public health. because belief in covid-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the us. vaccination is a cost-efficient intervention to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. among those undecided or unwilling to take the covid-19 vaccine, its safety and side effects were the most common concerns. however, achieving herd immunity does not mean eradicating covid-19, and the following challenges can occur in the process of achieving herd immunity. the covid-19 pandemic will end, but the virus will not disappear. 
4. Vaccines have other heavy metals along with nano particles that are excellent conductors for frequencies being beamed down. The reason chronically ill have most covid deaths b/c severe Gut damage is cause of most chronic illness, allowing particles into blood stream... [SEP] for covid-19 patients, advanced age, male, and patients with chronic disease are at higher risk of developing severe illness or even death. we believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of covid-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. as both elderliness and the aforementioned chronic conditions are often associated with an altered gut microbiota, resulting in disrupted gut barrier integrity, and gut symptoms have consistently been associated with more severe illness in covid-19 patients, it is possible that dysfunction of the gut as a whole influences covid-19 severity. covid-19 vaccines protect against sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 hospitalisation. the loss of the functional attributes of signature commensals in the gut, due to dysbiosis, is a predisposing factor of covid-19 pathophysiology. people with chronic conditions such as cancer, kidney disease, lung disease, diabetes, dementia, obesity, and heart conditions are at elevated risk of developing severe complications, and are thus at greater risk of death due to covid-19. the covid-19 vaccine is an effective measure to manage the pandemic as it prevents severe illness and death. obesity is strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long term. relatively high concentrations of anthropogenic metals, including zn, ni, fe, and cu, may be responsible for the higher toxicity of fine ambient particles compared with the ambient coarse particles and ufps. 
 People literally believe that the world is flat, 5G networks caused covid and that vaccines cause autism. This is par for the course… [SEP] this study monitors two established conspiracy narratives and their communities on twitter, the anti-vaccination and anti-5g communities, before and during the first uk lockdown. situations such as the covid-19 pandemic provides a favourable environment for misinformation to thrive. the upcoming 5g technology is one of the recent victims of misinformation and fake news and has been plagued with misinformation about the effects of its radiation. during the covid-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories linking the cause of the pandemic to 5g technology have resonated with a section of people leading to outcomes such as destructive attacks on 5g towers. in this paper, nlp based analysis of tweets linking covid-19 to 5g is presented. the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been mirrored by diffusion of misinformation and conspiracy theories about its origins (such as 5g cellular networks) and the motivations of preventive measures like vaccination, social distancing, and face masks (for example, as a political ploy). belief in misinformation or conspiratorial narratives may not be mutually exclusive from belief in the narrative reflecting scientific consensus; that is, profiles were distinguished not by belief in the zoonotic narrative, but rather by concomitant belief or disbelief in additional narratives. it raises the concern that will people believe and accept the new covid-19 vaccines despite all anti-vaccine movements and covid-19-related myths and conspiracy theories. this review discusses the possible detrimental impacts of myths and conspiracy theories related to covid-19 and vaccine on covid-19 vaccine refusals as well as other vaccine programs. covid-19 has literally ravaged the entire world. 
   That makes no sense.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If they have done so much work already why have they never got rid of the common cold.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid is noting like any other virus.

[SEP] they also completed the mccaul et al. psychologically, the mcs patient with a sensitized cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system is behaving as though his/her survival is directly threatened by these chemicals. infection by apple latent spherical virus (alsv) vectors that promote the expression of arabidopsis thaliana flowering locus t ( atft ) or gentiana triflora gtft s accelerates flowering in gentian and lisianthus plants. apple latent spherical virus (alsv) has isometric virus particles (25 nm in diameter) that contain two ssrna species (rna1 and rna2) and three capsid proteins (vp25, vp20, and vp24). alsv vectors are used for foreign gene expression and virus-induced gene silencing in a broad range of plant species. here, we report the infection by alsv vectors that express flowering locus t (atft) from arabidopsis thaliana or its homolog gtft1 from gentiana triflora in three gentian cultivars ('iwate yume aoi' [early flowering], 'iwate' [medium flowering], and 'alta' [late flowering]), and two lisianthus cultivars ('newlination pink ver. 2' and 'torukogikyou daburu mikkusu') promotes flowering within 90 days post-inoculation using particle bombardment. the promotion of flowering in the family gentianaceae by alsv vectors shortened the juvenile phase from 1-3 years to 3-5 months, and thus, it could be considered as a new plant breeding technique in ornamental gentian and lisianthus plants. tcas have been well studied and shown to be efficacious in the treatment of adhd, but are limited by side effects. especially, atomoxetine seems promising and newline drugs are in development. 
Know the facts! There is no evidence that #COVID19 #vaccines cause #infertility, says   &  https://t.co/c1u4QONH4b #NIAW2021 #InfertilityAwareness [SEP] a huge vaccination campaign has started around the world since the end of 2020. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a new disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). however, there are concern about the new covid-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. in addition, both coronavirus and covid-19 vaccine are new at this point and there is no scientific evidence to know whether people who are vaccinated can still carry the covid 19 pathogens and pass them along to others. we aimed to ascertain number of breakthrough covid19 infections after vaccinations in a chronic care, diabetes-centric healthcare facility. symptomatic covd19 infections occurred in 19 persons (16.9%) post any dose of vaccine. this article examines lay knowledge about causes of infertility. patients receiving dialysis may mount impaired responses to covid19 vaccination. more than one in five patients receiving dialysis had evidence of an attenuated immune response to covid19 vaccination. patients receiving dialysis face high likelihood of severe covid19; at the same time, vaccination may be less efficacious, as prior data indicate impaired immune responses to influenza and hepatitis b vaccination. 
  So, they die from lung failure caused by extreme pneumonia or heart failure from sludgy blood but the root cause is #COVID19 (which can be confirmed post-mortem) so the death is counted as due to the #coronavirus & NOT due to “natural” causes of pneumonia or heart attack ... /3 [SEP] five patients died from hypoxemic respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), five had another associated diagnosis and two died from alternative causes. deaths that occurred in the second week were related to sars-cov-2 pneumonia whereas those occurring earlier were related mainly to heart failure and those occurring later to complications. although covid-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure was the most common cause of death, post-mortem pathological examination revealed that acute decompensation from chronic comorbidities during the first week of covid-19 and complications in the third week contributed to mortality. at autopsy, broncho-pneumonia and pneumonia were the main causes of death. the most common underlying causes of death were pulmonary fibrosis at 27%, chronic obstructive lung disease at 18% and cancer at 27%. respiratory failure was the immediate cause of death in 64% of patients, cardiac causes in 27%, and pneumonia in 9%. in 23% of the patients, the cause of death was of pulmonary origin, while the remaining patients died of extrapulmonary complications (i.e. the immediate causes of death were reported as: respiratory (64%), cardiovascular (21%), or noncardiopulmonary (14%). the majority of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who had undergone a post mortem were found to have died from respiratory causes. in the age group of 65 years and above, the most common primary cause of mortality was pneumonia followed by heart failure and myocardial infarction. 
“It’s unclear if his death was related to the virus.” This is why we perform autopsies. There is a significant likelihood that #COVID19 played a role in that it is known to affect endothelial cells & has been shown to cause neurological symptoms including stroke. https://t.co/FeaX5KMPC4 [SEP] this study aims in assessing the mortality due to covid19 among patients below 30years of age in tamilnadu. details of the young covid19 deaths* under 30yrs of age, their gender, symptoms, co-morbidities, date of symptoms, date of admission, and death were collected till october 2020. the median time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was 3 days (iqr-3) and between admission and death was 4 days(iqr-7).there was a significant association of myocarditis, refractory seizures, central nervous system involvement as the cause of death in the age group 0-15years, compared with 16-30years(p < 0.05). but neurological symptoms including confusion, stroke, and encephalopathy are reported, and anosmia and hypogeusia are also common indicating that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) may be neurotropic. the relationship between encephalitis lethargica and post encephalitis parkinsonism to the spanish flu (h1n1 influenza virus) is unclear but raises the question of long term neurological complications of pandemics. there is a concern that there may be long term neurological sequelae of infection with sars-cov-2. histopathological analysis of the biopsies from the affected organs have implied a direct cytopathic effect of the virus but at the same time not ruling out other causes like hypoxia metabolic changes etc., occurring during the course of the disease. this fact could help to explain the highly varied presentation of patients with covid19 from bowel ischaemia to large vessel occlusion causing strokes in addition to the more common presentation of respiratory symptoms. although neurological complications of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection are common, the presence of cerebrovascular disease (cvd) has been seldom reported. autopsy findings of cvd were generally not related with clinical stroke before death. 
  COVID infection can cause a huge drop in sperm counts and infertility. The vaccine has not been associated with this. Vaccine safer than COVID for make fertility. [SEP] there is a hypothesis that testicular damage and subsequent infertility may result following covid-19 infection and the possibility of sexual transmission, as sars-cov-2 has been identified in the semen of infected patients. vaccine hesitancy in young women planning pregnancies has been heightened because of the spread of misinformation on social media stating that covid-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women. reassuring data from accidental pregnancies that have occurred in the clinical trials of approved covid-19 vaccines indicate that vaccination does not harm fertility or increase the rate of miscarriage. there has been some concern among the vaccine recipients regarding the potential effect of vaccine on male fertility. does covid-19 vaccine impair the sperm parameters? does pfizer's coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccination detrimentally affect semen analysis parameters? the results strengthen the notion that the pfizer's severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) vaccine is safe and should be recommended to men wishing to conceive. the objective of this review is to provide currently available information on the potential effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) on male fertility. due to studies that show covid-19 infection can affect sperm parameters and lead to orchitis, the public are concerned about the effect of the covid vaccines on male reproduction. there was a significant drop in the vaccine counts after emergence of covid-19 pandemic. 
 Severe Covid is a systemic disease not just confined to resp system.. causes hyper inflammation,clotting, encephalopathy etc..we need all hands on deck from generalists to specialists, nurses, ward attendants [SEP] a subgroup of covid-19 patients develop very severe disease with requirement for icu treatment, ventilation, and ecmo therapy. the covid-19 is an acute and contagious disease characterized by pneumonia and ards. the pathogenesis of covid-19 is highly complex and involves suppression of host antiviral and innate immune response, induction of oxidative stress followed by hyper inflammation described as the "cytokine storm," causing the acute lung injury, tissue fibrosis, and pneumonia. therefore, understanding sars-cov-2 induced hyper-inflammation in elderly men is a pressing need. the complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the clinical entity caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), are not limited to the respiratory system. a 46-year-old man with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection was admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) with severe covid-19. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly infectious pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the neurological complications of sars-cov-2 infection are high among those with severe and critical illnesses. this review highlights the central nervous system (cns) complications associated with covid-19 attributed to primary cns involvement due to rare direct neuroinvasion and more commonly secondary cns sequelae due to exuberant systemic innate-mediated hyper-inflammation. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has become a major outbreak in the world. 
Immunologist warns Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s  https://t.co/e41d3OssWU [SEP] this article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines. the key terms used were: coronavirus, sars-cov-2, covid-19 pandemic, vaccines, pfizer/biontech vaccine, moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the pfizer/biontech vaccine compared to the moderna covid-19 vaccine; however, the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. this case series reports the safety and immunogenicity of a graded administration of the second dose of the moderna and pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccines in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the first dose. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. a working group convened by the section of multiple sclerosis and neuroimmunology of the polish neurological society has developed a statement with regard to the currently available mrna vaccines (pfizer-biontech and moderna) preventing novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, sars-cov-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), in patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). both pfizer and moderna vaccines are mrna-based vaccines, and are estimated to have an efficacy rate of more than 94%. messenger rna (mrna) vaccines from pfizer&trade; and moderna&trade; are the first to market in the united states, and while cutaneous adverse events have been reported in clinical trials for both of these vaccines, they have not been well characterized. dermatologists should familiarize themselves with this and other potential cutaneous adverse events associated with covid-19 vaccination. 
(MERS) -- a far deadlier cousin of Covid-19 that scientists #fear could cause the next global #pandemic. #s63 #s63 #studio63 #journo #journalism #kenya #africa #nairobi #featurereporting #reporting #digitalcontent #contentcreator #humans #humaninterest #millenials #documentary [SEP] emerging highly transmissible viral infections such as sars-cov-2 pose a significant global threat to human health and the economy. since the sars/mers epidemic, scientists across the world have been racing to identify the novel-covs as it has been predicted that next epidemic can very well be a result from a new mutation of cov, for which hundred mutations have already been discovered, and the same fear has come true with world facing a raging pandemic due to covid-19, an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (sars-cov-2), is a single stranded rna virus. over the next weeks, sars-cov-2 caused a global pandemic as officially declared by the who on march 11, 2020, with confirmed cases and deaths in more than 166 countries. since the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak, there have been fears that the epidemic could strongly impact weaker healthcare systems in poor-resource settings, especially in sub-saharan africa (ssa). some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), and coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19). a systematic literature review was performed using the terms "human coronaviruses", "mers-cov", "sarscov", "sars-cov2", "covid-19", and "common cold" in ovid medline, pubmed, and cochrane library. the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in china caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has become a global concern and subsequently labeled a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11th. as the world mobilizes to contain the covid-19, scientists and public health experts are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak in africa. the recently emerged novel coronavirus, "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2)", caused a highly contagious disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
Is It Safe to Take a COVID-19 Vaccine?  Yes. Contrary to some rumors floating around, the COVID-19 vaccines are tested and safe for use. Aside from mild side effects, vaccines do not cause long-term health complications. To know more, talk to us.  #VijayPatelMD #COVID19Vaccine https://t.co/HoRRWvAUN7 [SEP] while short-term side effects of covid-19 vaccine resemble those of other vaccines, long-term side effects remain unknown. since the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) was declared a pandemic, there was no doubt that vaccination is the ideal protocol to tackle it. despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against covid-19 infection. finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that covid-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. the present study confirmed that the authorized covid-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. these vaccines have excellent safety profiles with few reported side effects. the unprecedented need to acquire a safe and effective vaccine for the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a global imperative. the first use of covid-19 mrna vaccines for individuals outside the clinical trials raised concerns over their safety and future efficacy. at this stage, a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine is the most sustainable option to manage the current pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of clinical trials for finding a safe and effective vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes covid-19. 
   Covid causes myocarditis much more frequently than a vaccine. [SEP] background: a possible association has been reported between covid-19 mrna vaccination and myocarditis. clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after covid-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes. despite our report, it appears that there is a significantly higher risk of cardiac involvement from covid-19 infection compared to covid-19 vaccination. recently, myocarditis following messenger rna (mrna) coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccination has become an important social issue worldwide. in conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and covid-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying cmr abnormalities. there have been reports of myocarditis following covid-19 vaccination. myocarditis following covid-19 mrna vaccines (pfizer-biontech and moderna) have been increasingly reported. we measured the incidence rate ratio for myocarditis temporally related to covid-19 mrna vaccination compared to myocarditis in a comparable population from 2016 through 2020. the overall incidence rate ratio (irr) of covid-19 related myocarditis was 4.18 (ci95% 1.63, 8.98) which was entirely attributable to an increased irr among adult males (irr 6.69, ci95% 2.35, 15.52) compared to females (irr 1.41, ci95% 0.03, 8.45).all cases occurred within 2 weeks of a dose of the covid-19 mrna vaccine with the majority occurring within 3 days (range 1-13 days) following the second dose (6/7 patients, 86%). myocarditis is a rare adverse event associated with covid-19 mrna vaccines, and in adult males it occurs with significantly higher incidence than the background population rate. 
Nina unqualified Twitter doctors [NEWLINE]STOP advising COVID positive people to not go to hospital when their symptoms worsen & breathing gets hard[NEWLINE]Hypoxia (less oxygen in your blood/tissue) can & will cause damage to their brain cells. Hence most COVID survivors experience memory loss [SEP] they range from early, low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) without breathlessness ("silent hypoxia"), delirium, rashes, and loss of smell (anosmia), to persisting chest pain, muscle weakness and -pain, fatigue, confusion, memory problems and difficulty to concentrate ("brain fog"), mood changes, and unexpected onset of hypertension or diabetes. this review examines how capillary damage and inflammation may contribute to these acute and persisting covid-19 symptoms by interfering with blood and tissue oxygenation and with brain function. the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov/sars-cov-2) causes respiratory symptoms including a substantial pulmonary dysfunction with worsening arterial hypoxemia (low blood oxygenation), eventually leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). a 52-year-old female admitted from an outside hospital with sob, intubated for worsening hypoxia, in the setting of covid-19 pneumonia. a 56-year-old female hospitalized with worsening sob, fever, and cough for 8 days saturating 88% on room air in the setting of covid-19 pneumonia. confusion, persistent fever and shortness of breath were identified as worrying symptoms suggestive of covid-19 disease progression necessitating urgent clinical contact. patients with this asymptomatic hypoxia seem to have a poorer prognosis. acute sars-cov-2 disease (covid-19) presents with deficits of memory, attention, movement coordination, and mood. in the hippocampus dentate gyrus of both covid-19 hamsters and humans, fewer cells expressed doublecortin, a marker of neuroblasts and immature neurons.despite absence of viral neurotropism, we find sars-cov-2-induced inflammation, and hypoxia in humans, affect brain regions essential for fine motor function, learning, memory, and emotional responses, and result in loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. neuroinflammation could affect cognition and behaviour via disruption of brain vasculature integrity, neurotransmission, and neurogenesis, acute effects that may persist in covid-19 survivors with long-covid symptoms. 
   Hypercapnia is a condition that can be easily corrected by your own body, or presents over days/hours due to underlying issues with your lungs caused by things like smoking damage, morbid obesity or - guess what - Covid 19.[NEWLINE]You can avoid Hyoercapnia by using a face covering. [SEP] currently, ards treatment is mainly mechanical ventilation, but mechanical ventilation often causes ventilator-induced lung injury (vili) accompanied by hypercapnia in 14% of patients. two patients with critical covid-19 combined with multiple organ failure undertook mechanical ventilation and suffered from hypercapnia. ecco2r combined with continuous blood purification therapy in patients with covid-19 who are criti-cally ill and have ards and hypercapnia might gain both time and opportunity in the treatment, down-regulate the ventilator parameters, reduce the incidence of vili and achieve favorable therapeutic outcomes. a lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes is a cornerstone to management, but uncontrolled hypercapnia is a life-threatening consequence among severe cases. a mechanism to prevent progressive hypercapnia may offset hemodynamic instability among patients who develop hypercapnia. we present the case of a woman in her mid-60's with severe acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to covid-19 pneumonia who was successfully treated with early implementation of lung-protective ventilation facilitated by extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ecco2r). she was transferred to our institution for advanced care where upon arrival, she had profound hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. the use of ecco2r successfully corrected and controlled the patient's hypercapnia and acidosis and enabled meaningful reductions in ventilator tidal volumes, respiratory rates, and mean airway pressures. background obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ohs) is characterized by a body mass index (bmi) ≥30 kg/m², daytime hypercapnia, an arterial carbon dioxide tension ≥45 mmhg, and obstructive sleep apnea (osa). case report a 53-year-old man, who was morbidly obese with a bmi of 75 kg/m², presented with shortness of breath (sob) and hypercapnia. 
 Out of the 3,000,000+ doses that were administered, 6 women got blood clots.  There are lots of medicines that cause this very rare side effect, and being vaccinated against COVID should be worth the risk. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated [SEP] blood clots, seizures, and tinnitus were very rare but were more common in the people who got the vaccine than in those who got the placebo. on 18 march 2021, ema's safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt). we report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine administration. we used the model to compare estimated deaths from az vaccine-associated tts with i) covid-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from covid-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). probability of dying from covid-related atypical severe blood clots was 58-126 times higher (depending on age and sex) than dying from tts. vaccination is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting a person against covid-19. however, covid-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. the aim of this review is to explore the reported cardiac adverse events associated with different types of covid-19 vaccines. thrombosis with thrombocytopenia has been noted as a rare side effect of covid 19 vaccine. the patients should also be health educated regarding side effects of vaccine especially with those indicating thrombosis and they should be warranted to receive immediate medical care in case of any side effects or complications. 
With the uncertainties associated with #COVID, many people have turned to food as a coping mechanism. Eating due to boredom or stress may provide temporary satisfaction. However, over time, this can cause weight gain and emotional distress. Read more 👉 https://t.co/cxvKKTkIiy [SEP] the coronavirus disease (covid-19) has dramatically altered daily activities including eating and physical activity behaviors, which in turn may be related to eating pathology. significant positive relationships emerged between stress and concern about weight gain before/during covid-19 and disordered eating, emotional eating-depression, emotional eating-anger/anxiety, and emotional eating-boredom. stress and concern about weight gain during, but not before, covid-19 positively predicted variance in disordered eating and emotional eating. stress was associated with lower emotional eating-boredom when concern about weight gain during covid-19 was low. stress was associated with lower emotional eating-depression when concern about weight gain before covid-19 was low, but when high, stress was associated with higher emotional eating-depression. stress and concern about weight gain before/during covid-19 may be relevant to worsened disordered eating and emotional eating in caregivers, a neglected population in the literature. targeting concern about weight gain may weaken the relationship between stress and emotional eating-depression and emotional eating-boredom among caregivers in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. distress was then associated with eating as a way of coping, which in turn was associated with increases in weight promoting eating behaviours. however, the participants resorted to emotional eating to cope with negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress caused by the pandemic. our study emphasizes that under stressful conditions, such as those experienced during the covid-19 pandemic, some coping strategies may contribute to the greater vulnerability to downstream effects, particularly those relating to eating choices and nutritional balances. 
  The vaccine has a higher survival rate yet conspiracy nutjobs freak out about that. See how it's disingenuous to focus only on survival rate? You're ignoring those critically ill - which included Boris in ICU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignore death statistics, look up the damage covid causes your body. https://t.co/1yTsjreJfm [SEP] the mortality of patients treated with imv was 51.1%, while only 17.5% of critically ill covid-19 patients treated with non-imv respiratory support died. additionally, the utilization rate of imv in non-survival patients was shown 17.26-folds (95%ci 2.89-103.24, p = 0.002) higher than that in survival patients, while the use rate of ecmo was no significant difference. imv is a life-saving strategy for critically ill covid-19 patients with ards, yet the mortality remains very high. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. similarly to endemic sepsis, the mortality of covid-19 critically ill patients is higher in low-income and middle-income countries as compared with high-income countries. the high mortality rates of critically ill patients with severe covid-19 disease are not only related to the severity of patient disease but also to modifiable factors, such as the icu strain, hai incidence, and organizational aspects. contrary to the lockdown strategy, some countries such as brazil have given priority to their economy leading to very high infection and mortality rates. after a first wave of the pandemic, we now know something critically important-those who are likely to become seriously ill and potentially die if sars-cov-2 infection is not prevented. we hypothesize that such "targeted prevention" strategies are more likely to help achieve our goals: 1) reduce mortality by preventing the infection reaching its potential victims, 2) spend the resources efficiently by knowing the "target" of our preventive efforts, and 3) achieve effective and efficient control of the pandemic without causing disruption to the socio-economic activities until an effective vaccine is available. the present study demonstrated that high boris expression was associated with decreased overall survival rate in patients with nsclc who received ddp chemotherapy. 
  Mental health is more complicated. It’s not either or. Don’t forget Covid itself will cause mental health issues in many suffering  irreversible organ damage, chronic pain and other long term neurological symptoms, plus grief from lost loved ones, trauma to nhs staff etc. [SEP] the direct impact of covid-19 on people infected with the virus, their families and the health care workers, as well as the impact of the mitigation measures such as quarantine, social distancing, and self-isolation on the rest of the population have contributed to a global mental health pandemic, including anxiety, depression, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychosis, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidality. and may continue long after the pandemic is over (for example, due to bereavement, unemployment, financial losses, etc). the covid-19 pandemic has triggered mental health problems in people without previous history of mental illness, as well as worsened the symptoms in those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. therefore, the global effort is called for to deal with this mental health pandemic secondary to covid-19 itself to address the emergence of new as well as the exacerbation of the existing mental health issues. in this viewpoint article we outline the particular suitability of mindfulness, its skills and mechanisms, as an approach to the prevention and management of mental health issues, as well as to the promotion of well-being and building the foundations of adaptability and flexibility in dealing with the long-term uncertainty and profound changes to the social, economic, and possibly political systems as this pandemic continues to unfold. the results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic brought unparalleled pressure, stress, and a dramatic change in practice to health care systems across the world. national health service (nhs) staff have reported higher levels of burnout, stress, and other mental health issues that they relate directly to the impact of the pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has constituted an extreme danger to global wellbeing and has become one of the major sources of morbidity and mortality around the world these days. it is more useful to examine responses to the pandemic utilizing contextualized grief and trauma aspects than to pathologize those reactions, particularly for those without existing mental health issues. 
Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/CeJM6NoGhQ [SEP] anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). here, we review the currently available evidence to discuss the plausible immunologic pathways that may contribute to the development of covid-19 neurological complications, namely alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, guillain-barre syndrome, seizure, and brainstem involvement. in this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the sars-cov-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. the neurological symptoms associated with covid-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and guillain-barre syndrome along with many others. covid-19 infection can show various manifestation, including neurologic manifestations, such as anosmia, ageusia, or dysgeusia, and causes the neurologic disorder such as stroke, guillain-barre syndrome, encephalopathy, and many more. covid-19 also affects the brain, which may result in a global or focal neurologic manifestation. numerous emerging reports have demonstrated that the covid-19 has detrimental effects on neurological functions, and can lead to severe impairment of the central nervous system (cns). the neurological manifestations linked with covid-19 include headache, anosmia, encephalitis, epileptic seizures, guillain-barre syndrome, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage alongwith multiple others complications. here, we present a brief review of the neurological complications and symptoms associated with covid-19 along with brain imaging findings. acute neurological disorders affecting patients with covid-19 range widely from anosmia, stroke, encephalopathy/encephalitis, and seizures to guillain-barre syndrome. 
  And to be clear I'm NOT trying to say that *only* the vaccine could cause an ADE issue in the future. Antibodies from surviving Covid-19 could potentially trigger the same problem. But what is impossible to know at this point is if the vaccine boosted antibody response could [SEP] vaccines for sars, mers and rsv have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, dna or rna and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen covid-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ade). antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. here we review observations relevant to the risks of ade of disease, and their potential implications for sars-cov-2 infection. second, because ade of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies-regardless of what virus is the causative agent-it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for covid-19 move forward. data from the study of sars-cov and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies could exacerbate covid-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ade). previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ade, resulting in failed vaccine trials. currently, little is known about the potential of vaccine-associated disease enhancement (vade) following covid-19 immunization. ade not only promotes the virus to be recognized by the target cell and enters the target cell, but also affects the signal transmission in the target cell. early formalin-inactivated virus vaccines such as aluminum adjuvants (rsv and measles) have been shown to induce ade. although there is no direct evidence that there is ade in covid-19, this potential risk is a huge challenge for prevention and vaccine development. 
Don't touch your face😱! We've all heard it can promote the spread of #covid . It's always a good idea, though. Touching your face introduces bacteria & irritants to your face that can exacerbate or cause acne & contact dermatitis. #udc #skinfacts #skincare #face #donttouch https://t.co/0UQYLIYky2 [SEP] advocacy of the use of facemasks by the public as a measure against the spread of covid-19 is controversial, with some healthcare professionals arguing that the use of a face mask may increase the rate at which people touch their faces, due to readjusting the mask. we assessed the facial touching behaviour of bus passengers in china before and after the outbreak of covid-19 and found that wearing a face mask does not increase the number of hand-face contacts and is likely, therefore, to have a positive beneficial effect on suppressing the spread of covid-19 within populations when used in conjunction with social distancing measures. this research compared the frequency of in-class face- and smartphone-touching behaviors of medical students before and after the delivery of personal hygiene education during the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 (sars-cov-2) pandemic is associated with aggravation of facial dermatoses caused by professional prophylactic measures, mostly face masks, especially reported in healthcare workers, such as irritant and contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, acne. objective: reducing face touching could help slow covid-19's spread. coughing, sneezing, and face touching activities are three primary ways of spreading disease. however, mask use has been thought to increase people's face-touching frequency and thus risk of self-inoculation. to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (covid-19), public health officials recommend against touching one's face, as the virus is transmitted through mucous membranes in the mouth, nose and eyes. the covid-19 pandemic has piqued interest in spontaneous face-touch as a possible route of microbial infection, with eye-touch of particular importance since the ocular surface is a likely portal of human coronavirus infection. the infective sequelae of self-touch are well documented in ophthalmological conditions such as infectious conjunctivitis, with risks for ocular surface disease beyond primary infection from pathogens such as human papillomavirus. 
The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccines works by effectively revving up the immune system to fight off the virus that causes the disease. But what if that same approach could be used to turn the immune system down to treat autoimmune disorders? https://t.co/YK3Rxfzed5 [NEWLINE]#mRNA [SEP] this could be a powerful approach to avoid possible autoimmune diseases after covid-19. due to its leading role in fighting infections, the human immune system has been the focus of many studies in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the aim of this review is to explain what happens to the immune system after recovery from covid-19 and/or vaccination against sars-cov-2, the virus that causes the disease. the content used in this paper has been taken from english language articles (2005-2020) retrieved from the pubmed database and google scholar search engine using "covid-19," "autoimmune disease," "therapeutic," "pathogenesis," and "pathway" keywords. the emergence of covid-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. the results showed that the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases can make diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 more challenging by preventing the fever. due to the common pathogenesis of covid-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus. this case suggests that mrna covid-19 vaccination may cause an autoimmune disorder. for the use of immune-modulating drugs in severe covid-19, it is important to balance the fight between the aggravated immune system and suppression of immune defense against the virus that causes secondary infection. this review provides an update on the immunotherapeutic interventions implemented to combat covid-19 along with the understanding of molecular aspects of the immune evasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which may provide opportunities to develop more effective and promising therapeutics. 
 I have APS, the syndrome which develops with both vaccine and covid to cause clots, had AZ with no ill effects but I'm anticoagulated. Those who aren't and then have other risk factors like OCP could be the ones developing these complications. It's just a blood test, easily done. [SEP] the term "lupus anticoagulant (la)" identifies a form of antiphospholipid antibodies (apls) causing prolongation of clotting tests in a phospholipid concentration-dependent manner. most publications either did not identify anticoagulation and/or crp in their covid-19 cohorts or did not seem to account for these as possible confounders for la detection. thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) has been associated with the astrazencea (az) covid-19 vaccine (vaxzevria). we used the model to compare estimated deaths from az vaccine-associated tts with i) covid-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from covid-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). the blood of the covid-19 patients were found to clotted than the patients were prescribed the anticoagulant injections are prescribed. antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (aps) is one such hypercoagulable state in which autoantibodies are formed against anionic phospholipid complexes. though appearing to be anticoagulated on ancillary testing, patients with aps are actually in a pro-thrombotic state requiring treatment with the anticoagulants heparin and warfarin. antiphospholipid antibodies (apas) increase the risk of excessive blood clotting, but their role in covid-19 remains unclear. we aimed to investigate the presence of conventional apas used in the classification of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in patients with severe lung infection with sars-cov-2 and to compare these results with non-covid-19 critically ill patients. anti-cardiolipin (aca) (igg, igm), anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2gpi) (igg, igm, and iga), and if the patient had not received any anti thrombotic agent before blood collection, lupus anticoagulant (lac) tests were studied from the plasma of the patients. 
   Only Covid19  Like how fi8nding means awareness and studies No funding means go and die in a ditch So 1/2 covid deaths were fungal or bacterial.  Maybe start there Do we have any scientist in Canada.Fungal respiratory infections kill millions, cause cancer, blindness NoBody cares https://t.co/eFqlGSkExt [SEP] patients with severe covid-19, such as individuals in intensive care units (icu), are exceptionally susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. the search was performed in medline (pubmed), using the words "fungal infections covid-19", between 2020-2021. this report illustrates the negative impact of secondary aspergillosis and calls for the need of increased awareness of covid19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. the emerging of the covid-19 pandemic is currently challenging for the public health system globally. starting late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has caused a devastating global pandemic of coronavirus-19 disease (covid-19) with ∼179 million cases and ∼3.9 million deaths to date. here, we describe the impact of the first 14 months of the covid-19 pandemic on mrl activities. some of the most important coinfections in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are opportunistic invasive fungal infections (oifis), which are sometimes not rapidly diagnosed and are often diagnosed after death. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has infected tens of millions of people worldwide within the last year. to investigate the association between fungal co-infection and mortality due to covid-19, we systematically searched medline, embase, medrxiv and cochrane library for eligible studies published in the period from 1 january to 1 december 2020. in terms of mortality in covid-19 patients with fungal infection, the overall pooled proportion of mortality was 0.17 (95% ci = 0.10-0.24, n = 1944, i2 = 95.6%). 
    Not to mention the lasting damage covid has on a person, we’re still finding out that covid can cause life changing issues, fibrosis, COPD, Diabetes, CKD, brain tissue death, to name a few these are in relatively Healthy people [SEP] ckd is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal covid-19 and the factor that most increases the risk of death in covid-19, after old age. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) disproportionately affects people with chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (ckd). incidences of covid-19, death, respiratory failure, dyspnea, recovery, intensive care admission, hospital admission, need for supplemental oxygen, hospital discharge, sepsis, short-term dialysis, acute kidney injury, and fatigue. what is worse, there are reasons to believe that fibrosis may become one of the major long-term complications of covid, even in asymptomatic individuals. covid-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative regarding the individual risk of severe illness and mortality. the virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after covid-19. in this study, we investigated the acute exacerbation and outcomes of copd patients during the outbreak of covid-19 and evaluated the prevalence and mortality of copd patients with confirmed covid-19. with cox regression, we examined the risks of covid-19-related hospitalisation, admission to icu, and death in relation to respiratory disease and use of ics, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic status and comorbidities associated with severe covid-19. people with copd and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from covid-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause. 
•In Africa, malaria has caused approximately four times as many deaths as COVID-19 over the past year.[NEWLINE]•Scientists are trialling a malaria vaccine which prevents the disease 77% of the time among those receiving it - a landmark which has never been reached before. [SEP] malaria remains a major global health burden, killing hundreds of thousands annually, especially in sub-saharan africa. here, we present perspectives on the collateral impact of covid-19 on malaria, especially in africa. the burden of malaria is heavily concentrated in sub-saharan africa (ssa) where cases and deaths associated with covid-19 are rising1. if activities are halted, the malaria burden in 2020 could be more than double that of 2019. the findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on malaria in ssa. if we look at the death toll caused by malaria, this year, it is closely nearing covid 19 deaths, 5, 68,700 deaths. we searched the literature to explore the evidence regarding efficacious antimalarial activities and the gap created by the covid 19 pandemic, responsible barriers, and challenges, with the possible approaches towards accomplishing a target for malaria control. an effective vaccine has long been envisaged as a valuable addition to the available tools for malaria control. malaria vaccine technology road map 2013 has envisaged the world aiming for a licensed vaccine by 2030 that would reduce malaria cases by 75% and be capable of eliminating malaria. we speculate that the high incidence of covid-19 cases and deaths in countries less affected by malaria is partly due to overexposure to malaria which led to the regular use of the artemisinin anti-malaria drugs as well as the regular use of bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg) vaccine for tb prevention. 
  No but keep in mind they also believe the world is flat and that 5G causes covid and vaccines cause infertility & autism 😒 [SEP] vaccine hesitancy in young women planning pregnancies has been heightened because of the spread of misinformation on social media stating that covid-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women. vaccinations are often the most effective tool against certain diseases known to mankind, and their interaction with multiple sclerosis (ms) has been discussed for decades. the world health organization (who) has stated that vaccinations against covid-19 are safer than not getting vaccinated. the world health organization declared this disease as a pandemic in march 2020. two-thirds of nurses stated that their knowledge on vaccines was from their education. the level of hesitance in those agreeing to the fact that vaccines caused autism and infertility, those stating that they did not trust vaccine-producing companies, and those stating that catching the disease was a better immunization method than vaccination was significantly higher than those not agreeing to these and those who were indecisive (p < .05).one-third of nurses was proven to have hesitance on childhood vaccines, and this rate is rather high. that vaccines do not cause autism is now a widely accepted proposition, though a few dissenters remain. an 8-year court process in the us federal vaccine injury compensation court ended in 2010 with rulings that autism was not an adverse reaction to vaccination. it is worth keeping in mind that covid-19 vaccination could induce immune-mediated bullous disease in susceptible people. at a time when many readily believe that vaccines cause autism, or that government scientists created aids as a weapon of black genocide, it is not surprising that medical quackery, especially cancer quackery, remains a flourishing and lucrative business throughout the developed world. 
                     DO NOT RECEIVE SATAN'S VACCINES[NEWLINE]VACCINES FORBIDDEN by THE CREATOR[NEWLINE]VACCINES do NOT PREVENT Covid19 infection or transmission of the virus.[NEWLINE]VACCINES cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects. [NEWLINE]VACCINES contain harmful ingredients. [NEWLINE]VACCINES MADE FOR PROFIT not MEDICAL REASONS https://t.co/MlETm8pZCE [SEP] however, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (vacv) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. however, use of the classical live vacv vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., hiv-infected patients). among unvaccinated medical residents, 71% indicated concern about vaccine-related side effects, including potential but unknown reactions (58%) and possible transmission of aids (37%) and hepatitis (16%). surgical residents were vaccinated if they believed hepatitis b vaccine was efficacious, but were not vaccinated if they believed hepatitis b virus infection was not serious. vaccination is a cornerstone of global public health. although licensed vaccines are generally extremely safe, both experimental and licensed vaccines are sometimes associated with rare serious adverse events. although rare, ved has important ethical implications because it can cause serious harm, including death, and such harms can undermine vaccine confidence more generally - leading to larger public health problems. we conclude this paper by summarising approaches to the reduction of risks and uncertainties related to ved, and the promotion of public trust in vaccines. parents should be aware of the potential serious side effects of the vaccine. self-reported barriers to uptake of the hendra virus vaccine by horse owners (n = 150) included concerns about vaccine safety, cost, and effectiveness. 
   Millions of people die every year from HIV virus, why is it that virus cannot be controlled and #COVID19 can, the same viruses that cause cancer, what makes Covid19 more important than the others, climate change, #climate measures, #reset economy, this is the #reason for Covid19! https://t.co/a14m4XUdzh [SEP] covid19 has become a challenging problem for organizations, countries and the world at large. the recent outbreak of the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) which causes covid19 disease has spread globally affecting millions of people. the outbreak the sars-cov-2 (cov-2) virus has resulted in over 6.5 million cases of covid19, greatly stressing global healthcare infrastructure. severity of corona virus disease 2019 (covid19) is presented with respiratory distress. the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (covid19) has spread rapidly since december 2019 in wuhan, china. on march 11, 2020 covid19 was declared pandemic by the who and as of may 1, 2020 covid19 disease continues to grow rapidly with 3,400,595 cases and 239,583 deaths world-wide. we summarize the covid19 tragedy in elderly care in sweden, particularly in the city of stockholm. the covid19 pandemic has turned out to be one of the public health* burdens in 2020. this study aims in assessing the mortality due to covid19 among patients below 30years of age in tamilnadu. understanding the age-dependent risk gradient and their trend of this new virus at young age* is essential for public health planning and prevent future deaths, future research gateways. 
 The worldwide Covid vaccine program is actually a gain-of-function exercise.  Geert Vanden Bossche and Bret Weinstein April 23 2021 https://t.co/Z3VDVJMChC  Ep 79.1: Viruses are messages; Can be hacked to control life and cause disease. https://t.co/TNKUUvJURZ [SEP] vaccine (world health organization. introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic continues to spread worldwide and vaccination remains the most effective approach to control covid-19. moreover, we present for the first time the details of current bcg vaccine clinical trials, which are underway in various countries, to assess its effectiveness in combating the covid-19 pandemic. finally, we discuss the challenges of covid-19 vaccines and opportunities for the bcg vaccine. if the efficacy of the bcg vaccine against covid-19 is confirmed by these clinical trials, the bcg vaccine may be essential to resolve the challenges faced by covid-19 vaccines. high vaccination rates and compliance with public health prevention measures are essential to control the covid-19 pandemic and to prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months. widespread vaccination remains the best option for controlling the spread of covid-19 and ending the pandemic. here we use two survey experiments to study how persuasive messaging affects covid-19 vaccine uptake intentions. one subgroup of messages draws on the idea that mass vaccination is a collective action problem and highlighting the prosocial benefit of vaccination or the reputational costs that one might incur if one chooses not to vaccinate. we find that persuasive messaging that invokes prosocial vaccination and social image concerns is effective at increasing intended uptake and also the willingness to persuade others and judgments of non-vaccinators. 
   It is very rare in the context of the vaccine and myocarditis in general. Vaccines cause side effects, they wouldn’t work otherwise. It’s simply just a reaction to your body making antibodies and C-Reactive Protein. And compared to actually getting covid, it’s not that bad. [SEP] here, we present a rare case of myocarditis following a covid-19 vaccine. learning objective: vaccination for coronavirus disease 2019 is advancing worldwide, but post-vaccination myocarditis is getting attention as a rare side effect. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. rare adverse events including myocarditis have been reported in the literature. four patients, ages 20 to 30, presented with myocarditis characterized by chest pain, elevations in troponin-i and c-reactive protein, and negative viral serologies two to four days following mrna vaccine administration. our case report raises concern that myocarditis is a rare side effect of covid-19 vaccine. this case report describes a 17-year-old male patient who developed focal myocarditis mimicking an st-segment elevation myocardial infarction (stemi) 3 days after administration of an mrna covid-19 vaccine. myocarditis is a rare complication in adolescents receiving mrna covid-19 vaccines. a new trend of myocarditis among young adults who received mrna vaccines for covid-19 is emerging. myocarditis is rare but is increasingly being reported in young adults post vaccination for covid-19.patients usually present with chest pain, elevated troponin and/or inflammatory markers.the condition carries a good prognosis and patients usually recover with supportive care. 
Interesting study. Please take your vaccine when offered it. The sooner you do, the faster we are out of these restrictions 🙏 x  Covid eight times more likely to cause rare brain clot than AstraZeneca vaccine, study finds https://t.co/mm5W9s4HJH [SEP] patients allergic to peg, previously denied covid vaccination, may now be safely vaccinated with the ps80 containing astrazeneca vaccine and need only avoid the peg-containing mrna covid-19 vaccines. this report describes the clinical context and autopsy findings in the first reported fatal case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (adem), developed after being vaccinated using the oxford/astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine. our case demonstrates that adem should be considered in patients developing neurological symptoms post covid-19 vaccination, although that this adverse reaction is likely to remain extremely rare. although individuals are advised to take the vaccine to protect themselves and the people around them from covid-19 infection, many are doubtful about the consequences of the vaccine. on 18 march 2021, ema's safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt). we report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine administration. the self-reported likelihood of taking an assigned astrazeneca or johnson & johnson vaccine was higher for respondents given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from covid-19 (b, 0.04; 95% ci, 0.01 to 0.06) and lower among those given information about its overall effectiveness at preventing symptomatic transmission (b, -0.03; 95% ci, -0.05 to 0.00), compared with those who were not given the information. from 11 march 2021, several european countries temporarily suspended the use of the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine amid reports of blood clot events and the death of a vaccinated person, despite the european medicines agency (ema) and the world health organization's assurance that there was no indication that vaccination was linked. with 17 million people having had the astrazeneca vaccine, these are extremely rare events the ema's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (18 march 2021) concluded that the vaccine was safe, effective and the benefits outweighed the risks. the rare but severe cerebral venous thrombosis occurring in some astrazeneca vaccine recipients has prompted some governments to suspend part of their covid-19 vaccination programmes. 
   Dying isn't the only effect. COVID is a vascular disease and has been shown to cause permanent brain damage. So it looks like we'll be supporting a large class of brain damaged conservatives. [SEP] increasing oxidative stress can lead to tissue damage while reducing brain blood flow. sulfur dioxide (so2) is one of the most important air pollutants that lead to the development of severe brain damage in large quantities. the special committee concurred that pertussis vaccine does produce permanent brain damage in rare instances. physicians are required to warn all responsible parties of vaccine recipients that pertussis vaccine may cause "lasting brain damage." but not the much more important and severe permanent brain damage, which is not taken into consideration in these so-called statistics. the emergence and global impact of covid-19 has focused the scientific and medical community on the pivotal influential role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia, on the understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, and on potential treatment for covid-19. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) poses a global challenge to healthcare and society in the early 21st century. we report neuropathological changes in 52 patients aged between 22 years and 88 years (median 58 years) who were infected with the cov-2 coronavirus. the light and electron microscopy examination confirmed the numerous neuropathological changes in the brains of the patients infected with the cov-2. hence, the brain changes due to covid-19 infection, could be called covid-19 cerebral angiopathy with diffuse inflammation. 
    covid vaccine doesn't cause fertility issues, or any of the things you mentioned  https://t.co/unEXqNzugT [SEP] headlines have appeared across multiple social media platforms questioning the effects of newly authorised covid-19 vaccines on fertility. although the effects on future fertility were not studied in the initial trials, at present, there is no evidence that the covid-19 vaccine has any effect of future fertility. here we summarise international consensus from multiple organisations advising on fertility and the covid-19 vaccine. preliminary studies all suggest that there is neither link, nor indeed any theoretical reason why any of the covid-19 vaccines might affect fertility. in this study, we discuss the potential mechanisms that justify the possible impact of covid-19 on male fertility. in general, there is little evidence for a definite conclusion, but there are facts that suggest that covid-19 may affect male fertility. although several fertility societies have announced that covid-19 mrna vaccines are unlikely to affect fertility, there is no denying that the current evidence is very limited, which is one of the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in the population, especially in pregnant women. on one hand, despite the low risk of infection in the male reproductive system or fetus, covid-19 could pose an enormous threat to human reproductive health. on the other hand, our review indicates that both men and women, especially pregnant women, have no fertility problems or increased adverse pregnancy outcomes after vaccination, and, in particular, the benefits of maternal antibodies transferred through the placenta outweigh any known or potential risks. conclusions: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has had a major impact on infertile couples. 
    I never said Covid-19 wasn’t a real coronavirus.  And deaths linked to Covid-19 are primarily caused directly from pneumonia, or flu-like symptoms.  The classifications for influenza and pneumonia reporting changed when Covid-19 appeared.  Facts. [SEP] covid-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2019-ncov. mild infections usually improve within a few days, but covid-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel coronavirus that was first discovered in december 2019 in wuhan, china. with the growing numbers of community spread cases worldwide, the world health organization (who) declared the covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic on march 11, 2020. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2, emerged in wuhan, china, in december 2019 and rapidly spread around the world. coronavirus disease (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus never identified before in humans. the coronavirus disease of 2019 (covid-19), which began in wuhan, china, at the end of 2019, is spreading around the world and causing many deaths, mainly from pneumonia. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a new virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a respiratory disease that ranges from an asymptomatic or mild flu-like illness to severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. since december 2019, we have been in the battlefield with a new threat to the humanity, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), characterized by viral pneumonia. 
COVID vaccine is likely to cause infertility issues through an autoimmune disorder that affects placenta development. What a wonderful coincidence that vaccines tend to cause autoimmune disorders, even a new experimental one. Btw, autism is being found to be an autoimmune issue. https://t.co/7hzF1xKybH [SEP] the current review summarizes case reports attributing autoimmune diseases and phenomena to various vaccines and suggests potential mechanisms. the data summarized here suggest that some vaccines may in rare cases induce autoimmune disorders. based on anecdotal observation, vaccination was proposed to cause autism in some children, but several controlled studies have failed to support this claim. the close temporal association between vaccine administration, recent covid-19, and relapse of remitted ttp raises concern for an enhanced immune reaction to covid-19 vaccine in the setting of recent covid-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. this case report exemplifies potential safety issues that may be encountered with new vaccine administration in patients with recent covid-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. other autoimmune illnesses have been associated with vaccinations. even though the data regarding the relation between vaccination and autoimmune disease is conflicting, it seems that some autoimmune phenomena are clearly related to immunization (e.g. this case suggests that mrna covid-19 vaccination may cause an autoimmune disorder. the potential association between vaccination and autoimmune diseases has been largely questioned in the past few years, but this assumption has mostly been based on case reports. we suggest that a potential link between vaccines and autoimmune diseases cannot be definitely ruled out and should be carefully explored during the development of new candidate vaccines. 
  All of these people are missing the long term unknown risks of covid infection. Epstein Barr Virus is a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, hep B & C cause liver cancer. 15% of cancers are viral! And people don’t want to risk vaccines???? [SEP] persistent infection, high viral load, and viral genotype are important risk predictors of these virus-caused cancers. risk calculators incorporating host and viral risk predictors have been developed for the prediction of long-term risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cervical cancer. persistent infection and high viral load are important risk predictors of these virus-caused cancers. the recent development of vaccines that can prevent infection and premalignant disease caused by human papillomaviruses (hpv), which cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer as well as some other cancers, has focused renewed attention on infection control as a means of reducing the global cancer burden. for vaccines to prevent cancer-causing infection with hepatitis c virus, helicobacter pylori, or epstein barr virus, new vaccine technologies to induce more effective protective responses are required. for the two available cancer control vaccines, designed to prevent infection with hpv and hepatitis b virus, the major challenge is to promote effective vaccine deployment through education programs and increased affordability/accessibility for underserved populations, particularly in the developing world, where the cancer burden attributable to infection by these two viruses is greatest. viral infection may play a causative role in human cancers, for example hepatitis b virus (hbv) or hepatitis c virus (hcv) in liver cancer, human papilloma virus (hpv) in cervical cancer, and epstein-barr virus (ebv) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. it is now estimated that approximately 10 % of worldwide cancers are attributable to viral infection, with the vast majority (>85 %) occurring in the developing world. the population attributable fraction (paf) and number of cancers caused by hepatitis b and c viruses (hbv, hcv), helicobacter pylori and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) were calculated using standard formulae incorporating prevalence of infection in the australian population, the relative risks associated with that infection and cancer incidence. the hpv vaccine represents a promising strategy to combat the increasing incidence of anal cancer. 
 Sorry[NEWLINE]Dexamethasone can cause blood clots, will help #COVID19 [NEWLINE]Try Tadalfil instead, it helps lungs, reduces inflammation and clotting[NEWLINE]Forget purpose of medicine, we need results [SEP] pulmonary embolism is a sudden occlusion of blood flow to the lungs by a blood clot that has usually arisen from a deep vein thrombosis. clots can break off and then travel through the heart to the lungs. large clots lodge in the main pulmonary artery, causing a potentially fatal blockage. smaller clots travel to the lung periphery where they may cause inflammation that results in pleuritic chest pain. the samples were examined for macroscopic blood clotting and microscopic platelet clumping. as a control, samples with heparin (n = 15) and without heparin (n = 15) were used to help evaluate the effectiveness of the anticoagulant properties within the ultratag rbc kit (sodium citrate) and whether those properties played a role in preventing clots or clumps. to detect clotting, the wooden applicator stick method was used. the two samples were compared for presence of clots and clumps. when heparin is not used, the ultra-tag rbc kit is more likely to form clots. tcas have been well studied and shown to be efficacious in the treatment of adhd, but are limited by side effects. 
  The viruses that cause flu are not the same species as COVID-19, please do not mix them up. Also, HPV does not cause flu, but its long term infection does lead to cancer. What NPR is saying is that long term COVID-19 infection may also lead to serious damage. [SEP] the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has caused devastating health, economic and social impact worldwide. the disease which is caused by the virus is termed covid-19. covid-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than flu a virus and rsv infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than flu a and b virus infection groups. influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of covid-19 in beijing. sars-cov-2, also referred to as cov-19, is an rna virus which can cause severe acute respiratory diseases (covid-19), with serious infection of the lower respiratory tract followed by bronchitis, pneumonia and fibrosis. the new cov-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the x chromosome. long-term consequences have also been reported and individuals (both males and females) who were exposed to the 1918 flu pandemic while in utero had a higher risk of developing schizophrenia, diabetes, coronary heart disease or cancer throughout their lifespan. we summarize the available literature on covid-19 suggesting an increased risk for severe disease progression in cancer patients, and we discuss the possibility that sars-cov-2 could contribute to cancer development. although sars-cov-2 is not considered an oncogenic virus, the possibility of increased risk of cancer among covid-19 survivors cannot be ruled out. we also highlight the potential long-term implications of covid-19 infection in the prognosis of patients with cancer and their response to different cancer treatments. 
If someone tells you the vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage. [SEP] the production of covid-19 vaccines has been tested for efficacy and safety via clinical trials. currently, the vaccine has been falsely reported to cause infertility in women of reproductive age and miscarriages in pregnant women. there is no evidence to support this information as the covid-19 vaccines have been clinically approved for safety. to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its associated impacts on health and society, covid-19 vaccines are essential. new challenges are now emerging concerning covid-19, such as associated reproductive implications and the consequences of assisted and natural procreation in the presence of acute sars-cov-2 infection and delayed consequences after patient recovery. there is a hypothesis that testicular damage and subsequent infertility may result following covid-19 infection and the possibility of sexual transmission, as sars-cov-2 has been identified in the semen of infected patients. vaccine hesitancy in young women planning pregnancies has been heightened because of the spread of misinformation on social media stating that covid-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women. reassuring data from accidental pregnancies that have occurred in the clinical trials of approved covid-19 vaccines indicate that vaccination does not harm fertility or increase the rate of miscarriage. immunocompromised patients make up a significant proportion of the population, and in light of recent mass vaccination efforts, we aim to review current evidence and recommendations of covid-19 vaccines in 4 patient populations with immunocompromising disorders or conditions: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, solid organ transplantation, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. thus, the covid-19 vaccine is recommended to be given to immunocompromised patients at this time, and providers should make efforts to decrease vaccine hesitancy in this population through education and reassurance. 
 3) Plus the death rate isn't the full story.  COVID-18 causes vascular damage.  This can result in secondary strokes, loss or reduction of various senses, cardiac problems, and one or more of those conditions which "immuno-compromise" one. [SEP] to elucidate the intertwining of vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors and covid-19. strokes are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors-and covid-19-are strongly intertwined. an increased risk of vascular events-by multifactorial mechanisms-has been observed in covid-19 patients. also, a higher rate of infection with covid-19, severe covid-19 and bad outcome has been demonstrated in patients with pre-existing vascular disease and vascular risk factors. a subset of patients with coronavirus 2 disease (covid-19) experience neurological complications. these complications include loss of sense of taste and smell, stroke, delirium, and neuromuscular signs and symptoms. stroke in covid-19 patients is likely a consequence of coagulopathy and injury to cerebral vascular endothelial cells that cause thrombo-embolism and stroke. it appears that most of neurologic complications in covid-19 patients are indirect and as a result of a bystander injury to neurons. once the heart is affected, there is progressive deterioration in the function of the heart over time. 
  The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA. Classen says mRNA vaccines may cause Alzheimer's, ALS, and Prion disease. He provides no evidence for these claims. He doesn't provide proof because there is none. [SEP] among them, the mrna vaccine platform technology holds great promise for obtaining an emergency use authorization to facilitate immunization against sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which causes the respiratory illness covid-19. vaccines of mrna work by providing our cells with the genetic code to make viral proteins. the use of messenger rna (mrna) vaccine platform offers new opportunities for the development of effective vaccines. in the past 20 years, the mrna vaccine technology has evolved from the first proof of concept to the first licensed vaccine against emerging pandemics such as sars-cov-2. mrna vaccines have received major attention in the fight against covid-19. in addition to alleviating the burden of covid-19, mrna vaccines could potentially provide long-term solutions all over the world for diseases ranging from influenza to aids. herein, we provide a brief commentary based on the history and development of mrna vaccines in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. this review gives a detailed overview about the types of mrna vaccines developed for sars-cov-2, discusses and compares preclinical and clinical data, gives a mechanistic overview about immune responses generated by mrna vaccination, and speculates on the challenges and promising future of this emergent vaccine platform. mrna technologies have recently proven clinical efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 and are among the most promising technologies to address the current pandemic. this paper reviews the technologies and processes used for developing mrna prophylactic vaccines, the current status of vaccine development, and discusses the immune responses induced by mrna vaccines. 
Each vaccine has its own side effects may cause even danger to life  Vaccines dont gaurentee prevention from supposed "covid hoax"...   Stop recomanding lockdowns and do vaccin orgy from here onwards .. https://t.co/uurJEyxt67 [SEP] when vaccination services are disrupted even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases increases, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. studies on the real-life effect of the bnt162b2 vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) prevention are urgently needed. during the covid-19 pandemic, different conspiracies have risen, with the most dangerous being those focusing on vaccines. as one of the most effective countermeasures against infectious diseases, an efficacious vaccine is considered crucial to containing the covid-19 pandemic. we aimed to analyze the effect of covid-19 pandemic on routine immunizations practice in pakistan. thus, this ongoing pandemic is a reminder for the national immunization programs to consider to tackle the disruption in routine immunization, otherwise, this continued disruption may lead to secondary outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases amongst the public. introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic continues to spread worldwide and vaccination remains the most effective approach to control covid-19. the routine vaccination services and outreach programs have been halted owing to lockdowns imposed on account of escalated cases of covid-19 all over the world, affecting millions of lives at the stake of vaccine-preventable disease (vpd) henceforth. however, as it is becoming evident that we will have to live with covid-19 for some time and many countries have lifted the lockdown, vaccination programs and campaigns have resumed with stringent preventive measures to be followed for covid-19. a significantly higher proportion of participants, who reported being vaccinated, or intended to receive the vaccine, stated that the covid-19 infection is dangerous, or varies from person to person; the vaccine is safe, and think there is a definite need for the vaccine (p < 0.001). 
   masks cause plague... fauci knows... masks promote bacteria... and not the good kind... sinus/lung/teeth and gum/tongue/etc... bacteriological infections... covid is crimes against humanity (:~:)https://t.co/VvPRwcVGPx [SEP] to determine patterns of mask wearing and other infection prevention behaviours, over two time periods of the covid-19 pandemic, in cities where mask wearing was not a cultural norm. data were analysed according to the epidemiology of covid-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. in the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic (spanish flu), health care professionals began to use face masks in a routine way to protect themselves and their patients. it is not by chance, therefore, that one of the consequences of the 2020 ongoing covid-19 pandemic should be the fact that face masks have become essential again both inside and outside health care environments. masks have become one of the most indispensable pieces of personal protective equipment and are important strategic products during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. in this article, we report a very simple approach for the decontamination of masks for multiple reuse during the covid-19 pandemic. currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of covid-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for covid-19. therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals wearing masks can still infect others due to viable microbial loads escaping from the masks. for this reason, during the current pandemic, many researchers have worked to develop face masks made of advanced materials with intrinsic antimicrobial, self-cleaning, reusable, and/or biodegradable properties, thereby providing extra protection against pathogens in a sustainable manner. protective facial masks reduce the spread of covid-19 infection and save lives. 
Quick lesson about autoimmune diseases and COVID-19. Auto-Immune disease causes the white blood cells that normally protect your body from invaders to turn around and attack your cells, tissues and organs. Chronic… https://t.co/551UkCqIH3 [SEP] interestingly, another consequence of this immune deregulation, is the production of autoantibodies and the subsequent development of autoimmune phenomena observed in some covid-19 patients with severe disease. simultaneously, lessons already learned from the immunobiology of covid-19 could offer new insights, not only for this disease, but also for a variety of chronic inflammatory responses observed in autoimmune and (auto)inflammatory diseases. covid-19 is an infectious and highly contagious disease caused by sars-cov-2. immune responses in covid-19 can both protect against the disease as well as drive it. however, if the immune system becomes dysfunctional, adaptive immune cells can react to self-antigens, which can result in autoimmune disease. viral infections are well reported to be associated with, or exacerbate, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). in covid-19 patients, both new onset ms and sle, as well as the occurrence of other autoimmune-like pathologies, have been reported. herein we describe the mechanisms of virally induced autoimmunity and summarise some of the emerging reports on the autoimmune-like diseases and autoreactivity that is reported to be associated with sars-cov-2 infection. autoimmune diseases arise when the immune system turns against normal components of the body. every imbalance in the accumulation of senescent cells between the immune system and the potential target organs can initiate a chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. 
 Actually wearing masks causes bacterial pneumonia which people can die from NOT covid19. Most people do not know how to don/doff PPE properly. Follow the science Big Guy! [SEP] in response to covid-19, the public should be encouraged to use face masks and are advised not to reuse or throw away masks at will due to safety concerns. indeed, healthcare workers working in high-risk areas, as well as the public, when social distancing cannot be assured, must wear ppe such as face mask and protective eyewear to prevent the transmission of sars-cov-2 infection. the masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza. it is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent. to determine patterns of mask wearing and other infection prevention behaviours, over two time periods of the covid-19 pandemic, in cities where mask wearing was not a cultural norm. a cross-sectional survey of masks and other preventive behaviours in adults aged ≥18 years was conducted in five cities: sydney and melbourne, australia; london, uk; and phoenix and new york, usa. data were analysed according to the epidemiology of covid-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of covid-19 reduced mask wearing. protective facial masks reduce the spread of covid-19 infection and save lives. although mask wearing is a convenient way to reduce the spread of disease, it is important to know how the mask affects our communication via facial expression. 
This Serology (blood) test, can verify the different types of antibodies developed after being exposed  to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is also known as Antibody Test.  [NEWLINE]#coronavirus #covid #corona #staysafe #socialdistancing#pandemic #virus https://t.co/efc4wI6LUR [SEP] while rt-pcr assays are used routinely to diagnose active covid-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. the presence of sars-cov-2 igg-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the covid-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. although molecular tests are considered the reference standard for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) diagnostics, serological and immunological tests may be useful in specific settings. this review summarizes the underlying principles and performance of covid-19 serological and immunological testing. serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of covid-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind covid-19. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which is caused by the novel sars-cov-2, continues to spread rapidly around the world, there is a need for well validated serological assays that allow the detection of viral specific antibody responses in covid-19 patients or recovered individuals. as the covid-19 pandemic has unfolded, interest has grown in antibody testing as a way to measure how far the infection has spread and to identify individuals who may be immune. this review currently focuses on giving an overview about the antibody tests in sars-cov-2 infections. lfia anti-sars-cov-2 antibody tests, igm and/or igg, known as serology tests, are used for identification if a person has previously been exposed to the virus or vaccine immunization. donors' igg antibodies were qualitatively immunoassayed to determine the antibody status against sars-cov-2. 
If the virus causes blood clots & if the vaxx can cause blood clots in some, wouldn't indiscriminate vaxx in the recently infected cause an even higher risk of clots?      think anyone at   cares?  https://t.co/FicR4O63qG [SEP] to study the contribution of influenza virus infection to cardiovascular thrombotic events, we develop a dynamic model which incorporates some key elements of the host immune response, inflammatory response, and blood coagulation. with blood clot formation inside an artery resulting from influenza virus infection as the primary outcome of this integrated model, we demonstrate how blood clot severity may depend on circulating prothrombin levels. our model provides a tool to explore how individual biological components contribute to blood clotting events in the presence of influenza infection, to identify individuals at risk of clotting based on their circulating prothrombin levels, and to guide the development of future vaccines to optimally interact with the immune system. jev was isolated from two igm-positive blood clots. this is the first report on isolation of jev from patient blood clots. new clinical findings of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis are coming out every day, and one such mystery is the formation of mysterious blood clots in the various tissues and organs of covid-19 patients, which needs critical attention. this viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. large clots lodge in the main pulmonary artery, causing a potentially fatal blockage. smaller clots travel to the lung periphery where they may cause inflammation that results in pleuritic chest pain. many patients with haemophilia are infected with viruses, due to treatment with blood products--particularly from large pool clotting factor concentrates before 1985. 
Australia's vaccine roll-out setbacks take shine off its Covid-19 success: April 16, 2021 10:00 AMHeavy reliance on the AstraZeneca shot, which may cause blood clots, and lack of information on supply have drawn… https://t.co/HvcYwmnH1Q #guestpost #lastminutenews #guestposting https://t.co/OpkJh3dxM8 [SEP] the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). to evaluate the occurrence, extent, and severity of adverse reactions associated with the vaccine of covid-19 (chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine or astrazeneca) among kabul university of medical sciences staff. a retrospective observational, interview-based study was conducted from 4 to 20 april, 2021, to evaluate the adverse reactions associated with the vaccine of covid-19 (chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine or astrazeneca) among the staff and lecturers of the kabul university of medical sciences, kabul, afghanistan. the oxford-astrazeneca is one of covid-19 vaccine which is expected to be mass-produced and plays a critical role in controlling the pandemic that the globe faced. this online study was conducted from april 15 to 30, 2021 at a national level across health care providers who took their first dose of oxford-astrazeneca vaccine in ethiopia. on 15 march 2021, italian medicines agency (aifa) decided to temporarily suspend the use of the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine throughout the country as a precaution, pending the rulings of the european medicines agency (ema). on 18 march 2021, ema's safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt). we report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine administration. the self-reported likelihood of taking an assigned astrazeneca or johnson & johnson vaccine was higher for respondents given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from covid-19 (b, 0.04; 95% ci, 0.01 to 0.06) and lower among those given information about its overall effectiveness at preventing symptomatic transmission (b, -0.03; 95% ci, -0.05 to 0.00), compared with those who were not given the information. 
 The immune response to COVID can kill (see cytokine storm and note that both the virus and the vaccine can cause clotting) so why are we deliberately creating immune responses with vaccinations? The vaccine is just another way that people can initiate the deadly immune response [SEP] as the sars-cov-2 virus wreaks havoc on the populations, health care infrastructures and economies of nations around the world, finding ways to protect health care workers and bolster immune responses in the general population while we await an effective vaccine will be the difference between life and death for many people. apart from natural immune responses, vaccination against sars-cov-2 turned out to be very effective and much safer than naturally acquired immunity. it is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly mutable coronavirus sars-cov-2. due to its leading role in fighting infections, the human immune system has been the focus of many studies in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the aim of this review is to explain what happens to the immune system after recovery from covid-19 and/or vaccination against sars-cov-2, the virus that causes the disease. further, we explain the reason why immunity after covid-19 infection plus a vaccination appears to induce a stronger response compared with virus exposure alone. in conclusion, we reinforce that vaccination is safe and important in achieving herd immunity. safe and effective anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines are urgently needed. here we describe dysfunctional immune responses induced by coronaviruses, representing potentially difficult to overcome obstacles to safe, effective vaccine development for covid-19, and outline how trained immunity could help protect high risk populations through immunomodulation with bcg and other "new old friends." the emergence of new viral strains, together with vaccination and reinfections, are all contributing to a long-term immunity against the deadly virus that has taken over the world since its introduction to humans in late december 2019. 
Cytokine storms occur when the body’s immune system attacks itself, and has been noted as a leading cause of death in patients suffering infected with #Covid-19.  https://t.co/pfmd08gNtA [SEP] in many individuals who had suffered sars-cov-2 infection, cytokine storm starts through cytokine overproduction and leads to acute respiratory syndrome (ars), organ failure, and death. systemic immune over activation due to sars-cov-2 infection causes the cytokine storm, which is especially noteworthy in severely ill patients with covid-19. pieces of evidence from current studies have shown that the cytokine storm may be an important factor in disease progression, even leading to multiple organ failure and death. several studies have reported that cytokine storms are an important cause of disease deterioration and death in covid-19 patients. consequently, it is important to understand the specific pathophysiological processes underlying how cytokine storms promote the deterioration of covid-19. here, we outline the pathophysiological processes through which cytokine storms contribute to the deterioration of sars-cov-2 infection and describe the interaction between sars-cov-2 and the immune system, as well as the pathophysiology of immune response dysfunction that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (mods), and coagulation impairment. in this review, we will focus on cytokine storm in covid-19 patients, their impact on the body organs, and the potential treatment by qty code-designed detergent-free chemokine receptors. a particularly insidious aspect of covid-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. this review summarizes the current understanding of the immunopathogenesis of severe covid-19, especially the role of the inflammatory cytokine storm in disease progression. covid-19 causes cytokine storm, which subsequently leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), often ending up in the death of patients. 
How the vaccine works: The Pfizer/BioTech COVID-19 vaccine contains the Messenger RNA which is packaged in a lipid envelop that allows the messenger RNA to enter the cells. This will cause the cells to produce the COVID-19 cell protein. When the protein is released from the cells [SEP] recently, the oxford university and pfizer and biontech made sars-cov-2 vaccines through targeting the spike protein gene. the us food and drug administration (fda) and the health authorities of the united kingdom approved and started vaccination using the pfizer and biontech mrna vaccine. here, we report a case of secondary itp in a patient who was recently immunised with the messenger rna covid-19 vaccine bnt162b2 (pfizer-biontech). during the covid-19 pandemic, the use of mrna as a vaccine became more relevant; two out of the four most widely applied vaccines against covid-19 in the world are based on this platform. based on these advantages, this review emphasizes mrna and self-amplifying rna (sarna) for vaccine development, mainly to fight against covid-19, together with the challenges related to this approach. the mrna vaccines have been created using a novel technology and they contain a synthetically created rna sequence of virus fragments encoding the s-protein which is injected. in the case of viral vector-based vaccines, genes encoding the sars-cov-2 s protein are isolated and following gene sequencings are introduced into the adenovirus vector. these vaccines are based on messenger rna novel technology and considered efficient in preventing contagion ensuring safety. here, we present the cases of three patients who developed lymphadenopathy after the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. cutaneous reactions after messenger rna (mrna)-based covid-19 vaccines have been reported but are not well characterized. 
Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the USA, more Americans are dying with Covid-19 than Ischemic heart disease, Lung cancer, or COPD! We need Herd immunity from 70-80% of the population vaccinated! [SEP] vaccination is considered to be the most effective measure for preventing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected covid-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating covid-19 in human populations. simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with covid-19 mortality data for the u.s., show that, for an anti-covid-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible us population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. the prospect of covid-19 elimination in the us, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. vaccination remains a critical element in the eventual solution to the covid-19 public health crisis. the emergence of covid-19 vaccine is a step towards the achievement of herd immunity. there is an urgent need for effective countermeasures against the current emergence and accelerating expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). induction of herd immunity by mass vaccination has been a very successful strategy for preventing the spread of many infectious diseases, hence protecting the most vulnerable population groups unable to develop immunity, for example individuals with immunodeficiencies or a weakened immune system due to underlying medical or debilitating conditions. therefore, vaccination represents one of the most promising counter-pandemic measures to covid-19. nevertheless, covid-19 vaccines will be essential in the future for reducing morbidity and mortality and inducing herd immunity, if sars-cov-2 becomes established in the population like for example influenza virus. 
In some cases, long Covid could mean lifelong Covid = lung damage, heart damage and brain damage that can cause memory loss and brain fog, kidney damage, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, loss of taste and smell, anxiety, depression and, above all, fatigue. https://t.co/cZfcObJGOA [SEP] our purpose was to review the empirical evidence on symptom prevalence, complications, and management of patients with long covid. we systematically reviewed the literature on the clinical manifestations of long covid-19, defined by the persistence of symptoms beyond the acute phase of infection. while the precise definition of long covid may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute covid-19. other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. in brief, long covid may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. the most common prevalent long-term symptoms in covid-19 patients included persistent fatigue and dyspnea in almost all of the studies. patients with 'long covid' experience a wide range of physical and mental/psychological symptoms. beyond symptoms and complications, people with long covid often reported impaired quality of life, mental health and employment issues. in addition to these primarily respiratory symptoms, sars-cov-2 can also infiltrate the central nervous system, which may damage the blood-brain barrier and the neuron's synapses. it is known that the covid-19 disease, which has affected the whole world, causes symptoms, such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, headache and sore throat, in addition to various clinical findings, such as loss of smell and taste. 
  Covid just became the 6th leading cause of death in ohio. Is there a reason we aren't trying to stop Heart disease? [SEP] the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) recently became one of the leading causes of death worldwide, similar to cardiovascular disease (cvd). we analyzed the impact of cvd and the use of cardiovascular drugs on the in-hospital course and mortality of patients with covid-19. among cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, hf and dm appeared to increase in-hospital covid-19 mortality, whereas the use of cardiovascular drugs was associated with lower mortality. the economic toll from cardiovascular diseases is equally devastating, leading to billions of dollars lost due to healthcare costs and reduced productivity from the disabling and fatal outcomes related to diabetes, hypertension, stroke, valvular heart disease, and heart failure. as covid-19 became better understood, cardiovascular manifestations associated with it were identified. there are a lot of questions over how covid-19 affects patients with heart failure (hf) as this condition is a leading cause of cardiovascular death. this review describes the cardiovascular implications of covid-19 and new practices surrounding the use of telehealth to follow up and triage patients with hf. heart disease has been a leading cause of death in the united states for a last few decades, even with significant improvements in treatment and management. heart disease deaths are overreported in the united states. we evaluated the impact of an intervention to reduce heart disease overreporting on other leading causes of death. 
Animals and #COVID19[NEWLINE]The virus that causes COVID-19 is different than other coronaviruses that affect domestic animals. Learn how to keep pets and livestock, as well as yourself, safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/jTwdvBhDPM [SEP] it is now known that sars-cov-2 can affect not only humans but also pets and other domestic and wild animals, making it a one health global problem. this review summarized the current evidence about the role of pets and other animals in the transmission of covid-19. the virus responsible for the pandemic that has affected 152 countries worldwide is a new strain of coronavirus (cov), which belongs to a family of viruses widespread in many animal species, including birds, and mammals including humans. in this review we describe some strategies applied in veterinary medicine to control cov and discuss if they may help to develop practical and useful strategies to control the sars-cov-2/covid-19 pandemic. few reports indicate that owned pets from households with at least one human resident that was diagnosed with covid-19 can be infected by sars-cov-2. serological data presented here suggest that not only owned pets from households with covid19 cases, but also stray animals are being exposed to sars-cov-2 during the covid-19 pandemic. sars-cov-2 has been isolated from domestic animals, both companion and livestock, as well as in captive wildlife that were in close contact with human covid-19 cases. therefore, our aim is to review reported cases of animals naturally infected with sars-cov-2, particularly companion pets, shedding light on the role of these animals in the epidemiology of covid-19. coronaviruses are an extensive family of viruses that can cause disease in both animals and humans. restrictions during the covid-19 pandemic may affect the lives of pet animals. 
   What do you consider minute? 3%?[NEWLINE]Then there's long covid that can include fatigue, lung damage, heart damage, secondary infection, thrombosis and nerve damage.[NEWLINE]All can cause severe after effects and in some cases, death after the 28 day cut off for reporting covid deaths. [SEP] while sars-cov-2-triggered hyperinflammatory tissue-damaging and immunothrombotic responses are thought to be major causes of respiratory failure and death, how they relate to lung immunopathological changes remains unclear. infection by sars-cov-2 produces significant pulmonary pathology including endothelial damage with resultant thrombotic events. patients by long - term exposure to polluted air leads to chronic lung and heart conditions are less able to fight off lung infections and likely to die. cardiovascular problems due to covid-19 infection include acute coronary syndrome (due to coronary occlusion, thrombosis), myocardial damage without coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, pericardial effusion, and thromboembolic events. the patient had a history of hospitalization for seven days in the outpatient clinic and 10 days in the intensive care unit due to covid-19 infection with severe lung involvement. we identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe covid-19 and decompensation in this demographic. the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 originates in the lungs, but it may extend to other organs, causing, in severe cases, multiorgan damage, including cardiac injury and acute kidney injury. covid-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake, but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation. the complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to sars-cov-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation, and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death. despite intensive medical treatments, she developed respiratory failure with secondary bacterial infection and expired on hospital day 23 (3 days after she was tested positive for sars-cov-2 rna). 
Researchers believe that the inflammation may lead to heart failure.- German Study[NEWLINE]COVID-19 may increase the risk of blood clots, which may cause heart damage or heart attacks in some people. [SEP] despite the respiratory complication, covid-19 is also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction, including severe cardiac impairment. emerging evidence reveals a direct interplay between covid-19 and dire cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure, heart attack, myocarditis, arrhythmias as well as blood clots, which are accompanied with elevated risk and adverse outcome among infected patients, even sudden death. the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of myocardial impairment include invasion of sars-cov-2 virus via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to cardiovascular cells/tissue, which leads to endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, de-stabilization of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, stent thrombosis, cardiac stress due to diminish oxygen supply and cardiac muscle damage, and myocardial infarction. the novel coronavirus is not only causing respiratory problems, but it may also damage the heart, kidneys, liver, and other organs; in wuhan, 14 to 30% of covid-19 patients have lost their kidney function and now require either dialysis or kidney transplants. however, these proteins can cause blood clotting, which can clog blood vessels in the heart and other organs; as a result, the organs are deprived of oxygen and nutrients which could ultimately lead to multiorgan failure and consequent progression to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and often death. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) may cause not only an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) but also multiple organ damage and failure requiring intensive care and leading to death. in the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/covid cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-covid-19 sequelae. co-morbid conditions primarily cardiovascular complications and diabetes have been reported to show a strong correlation with covid-19 severity. oxidative stress also causes myocardial tissue damage and inflammation, contributing to heart failure progression. cholesterol-enriched plaques in the heart's blood vessels combined with inflammation lead to the lesion expansion, narrowing of blood vessels, reduced blood flow, and may subsequently cause lesion rupture and a heart attack. 
Need encouragement to get the vaccine, or know someone who does? CCNY  student Clarence Kong explains how the vaccines work and exactly why they cannot cause COVID-19 infection. #VaxUpCUNY #VaccinesSaveLives https://t.co/1JvDAZgRhP [SEP] most strategies for reducing covid-19 vaccination hesitancy focus on highlighting the benefits of covid-19 vaccines. we suggest that the dangers of not getting the vaccine should also be emphasized as many people who do not know someone who was affected with covid-19 are also hesitant towards vaccination. these individuals may not fully appreciate the morbidity and mortality impact of covid-19 infections and the messaging can be tailored to highlight the risk of not having vaccines. the majority of university students intend to get the covid-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. to encourage maximum vaccination against covid-19, determinants of vaccination intention must be identified. as the covid-19 pandemic continues, safe and effective vaccines with high coverage remain the most effective way of controlling the infection. more efforts are needed to enhance vaccine confidence and increase the vaccination rates against covid-19 in nursing students by organizing effective educational campaigns and establishing positive vaccination beliefs. one of the most efficient methods to control the high infection rate of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is to have a high coverage of covid-19 vaccination worldwide. in understanding how and why coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mrna vaccines work, school nurses are in a trusted position to explain and advocate vaccination to students and their caregivers. a better understanding of how and why this vaccination is effective may prevent vaccination hesitancy and provide reassurance to those choosing to accept vaccination. 
  Are you aware that the vaccines could cause miscarriage? The real data regarding covid is that there are tiny numbers, percentage wise, of generally healthy people under the age of 60 that die from COVID or that get admitted into ICU. Are you worried about cancer too? https://t.co/gFOUxRcWTW [SEP] older age, feeling optimistic about the effectiveness of covid-19 vaccination, believing that vaccination decreases worries and risk of covid-19 infection, and being less concerned about side effects and safety of covid-19 vaccination under the hbm construct were found to be significant factors in covid-19 vaccination intention. compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. regarding willingness to covid-19 vaccination, participants were asked to answer the following question: "if there was a vaccine available for the novel coronavirus, would you do it?" respondents aged > 65 years old, those who either themselves or a member of their household belonged to a vulnerable group, those believing that the covid-19 virus was not developed in laboratories by humans, those believing that coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal compared to the h1n1 virus, and those believing that next waves are coming were statistically significantly more likely to be willing to get a covid-19 vaccine. a significant proportion of individuals in the general population are unwilling to receive a covid-19 vaccine, stressing the need for public health officials to take immediate awareness-raising measures. perceived destructive impact of covid-19, positive perception of vaccines and concern about possible side effects were significant in modifying respondents' intentions.. vaccination could be a key protective measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and it is important to understand the acceptability of the covid-19 vaccine among the general public. emerging efficacy and safety data have led to the authorization of covid-19 vaccines worldwide, but most trials excluded patients with active malignancies. the primary outcome was the intended acceptance of covid-19 vaccine in cancer patients. over 70% worried about vaccine negative effects on cancer and its side effects. 
 I think systemically injecting spike protein causes an exaggerated immune response that is identical 2systemic COVID infection in frail elderly. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The immune response does the damage only this time because it’s injected systemically bypassing the innate system we see ICU & death. [SEP] elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases account for a large proportion of corona virus disease 2019(covid-19)related deaths. covid-19 infection further aggravates the existing inflammatory process and lymphocyte depletion leading to uncontrollable systemic inflammatory responses, which is the primary cause of death. based on the higher mortality, this study attempts to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of covid-19 in elderly subjects with cardiovascular diseases as well as the cause of the high mortality result from covid-19. this paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe covid-19. although anti-spike antibodies may hinder infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike protein may facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. details of this hypothesis are in concordance with many clinical characteristics of covid-19, including its predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of disease in children. it predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been shown for other coronaviruses. vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular immunity covid-19 and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins except for the immunodominant spike protein. thus, covid-19 would arise as a simple viral infection, develop as a diffuse immune complex hypersensitivity and explode as a systemic hemo-vascular pathology. 
 in addition to that,  covid is viral in nature — no antibiotic can ever kill viral pathogens.  antibiotics are used if there is a bacterial cause and not viral cause.  i hope i made that clear. [SEP] the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has affected millions of people worldwide. efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of covid-19 are underway. numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., sars-cov-2). although antibiotics do not directly affect sars-cov-2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. it is possible that some patients die from bacterial co-infection rather than virus itself. in this review, we will summarize the bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection in some featured respiratory viral infections, especially covid-19. this article discusses antibiotic therapy based on clinical presentation and based on identified pathogens, with a discussion of mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the newer agents that have been designed to meet this continually evolving challenge. the use of antibiotics in viral diseases of childhood is discussed. by contrast, antibiotics are not used in bronchiolitis or asthma. the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic is demanding the rapid action of the authorities and scientific community in order to find new antimicrobial solutions that could inactivate the pathogen sars-cov-2 that causes this disease. 
Certain diseases like CHF, COPD, and some viral illnesses like COVID-19 can cause an increased risk for hospital readmissions. Our signature wellness programs, like Just Breathe, can help your patients stay out of the hospital. #chf #copd #COVID19 #respiratorycare #healthcare https://t.co/a966Shb0wl [SEP] congestive heart failure (chf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) were the medical conditions responsible for most readmissions. a higher proportion of patients with cld were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days (25% vs 21.9% of patients with chf and 20.6% with copd, p < .01). the hospital readmissions reduction program targets medicare patients with congestive heart failure (chf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and penalizes hospitals that have increased 30-day readmission rates for these patients. the medical records department at university medical center in lubbock, texas, generated a list of patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of either acute exacerbation of chf or an acute exacerbation of copd who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. the final study cohorts included 58 admission-readmission events for acute exacerbations of chf (47 patients) and 27 admission-readmission events for acute exacerbations of copd (16 patients). patients with acute exacerbations of copd or chf who require readmission within 30 days have complex comorbidity. patients with congestive heart failure (chf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) account for most 30-day hospital readmissions nationwide. eligible patients were admitted with chf or copd and had at least one additional risk for readmission. readmission following hospital discharge is common and is a major financial burden on healthcare systems. post-discharge interventions reduced all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and cause-specific hospitalization in chf patients and all-cause hospitalization in copd patients. 
  Sad enough Covid-19 can cause SOME cardiovascular Diseases, and it has only been 7-8 months since the first case, with no vaccine in sight, things are going to get worse, the numbers will rise even more.. [SEP] patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (cvd) are at a higher risk for severe manifestations of both illnesses. considering the high transmission rate of covid-19 and with the seasonal influenza approaching in late 2020, the dual epidemics of covid-19 and influenza pose serious cardiovascular implications. additionally, a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes has been noted in patients with cvd, with ~ 15 to 70% of covid-19 related deaths having an underlying cvd. unexpectedly, while peak influenza season is associated with increased cardiovascular hospitalizations, a decrease of ~ 50% in cardiovascular hospitalizations has been observed since the first diagnosed case of covid-19, owing in part to deferred care. the outbreak of corona virus in late december 2019 (also known as covid-19) raised major concerns when the outbreak started getting tremendous. given the increasing number of deaths, the covid-19 has caused havoc worldwide and is a matter of serious concern. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. we hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and cardiovascular disease patients around the world cope with the covid-19 pandemic. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. we hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and cardiovascular disease patients around the world cope with the covid-19 pandemic. 
 COVID is also known to cause myocarditis, so it seems likely to me that this is caused by the spike protein, or an allergic reaction to the spike protein. Seems wrong to call it a side effect of the vaccine, per se. [SEP] covid-19 causes several cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, myocarditis, pericarditis, and venous thromboembolism. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. rare cases of severe allergic reactions after covid-19 vaccination have been observed, seemingly at a higher frequency than for other vaccines. the underlying immunological mechanisms of the rare severe allergic reactions to the covid-19 vaccines are poorly understood and need to be clarified. vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt) is a severe adverse effect of chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 vaccine (vaxzevria) and janssen ad26.cov2.s covid-19 vaccine, and it is associated with unusual thrombosis. these findings raise concern that vaccination-induced antibodies against anti-sars-cov-2 spike protein cause thrombosis by cross-reacting with pf4. similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. this review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against covid-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. thus, it is important to be aware that the spike protein produced by the new covid-19 vaccines may also affect the host cells. 
                                                 Covid causes blood clots that cause heart attack, stroke, general organ damage and affect cognition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are also much more vulnerable to dying from this damage if your circulatory system is already compromised by diabetes, obesity etc. [SEP] diabetes has immune defects which makes the individual susceptible to infections and covid 19 is no exception . also covid 19 can cause pancreatic damage as well as stress hyperglycaemia in hospitals which may need insulin . the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) may cause not only an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) but also multiple organ damage and failure requiring intensive care and leading to death. in the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/covid cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-covid-19 sequelae. preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammation-mediated systemic cytokine storm. the blood-coagulation cascade is also relevant to diseases such as hemophilia, in which patients are deficient in blood proteins necessary for clotting, and is linked to vascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, in which clotting can lead to the occlusion of blood vessels. while the anti-viral immune response is important to protect from coronavirus infection, an uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine response can lead to cytokine storm which causes damage to the lungs and other organs, causing significant morbidity and mortality. sars cov-2 affects the microcirculation, causing endothelial cell swelling and damage (endotheliitis), microscopic blood clots (microthrombosis), capillary congestion, and damage to pericytes that are integral to capillary integrity and barrier function, tissue repair (angiogenesis), and scar formation. similar to other instances of critical illness, covid-19 is also associated with elevated cytokine levels in the systemic circulation. this review examines how capillary damage and inflammation may contribute to these acute and persisting covid-19 symptoms by interfering with blood and tissue oxygenation and with brain function. 
cause of cognitive injury could be seen if the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes covid-19, crosses the blood-brain barrier and directly attacks neural tissue [SEP] because sars-cov-2 s1 protein can be released from viral membranes, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and is present in brain cells including neurons, we tested the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 s1 protein can directly induce neuronal injury. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sar-cov-2) has been shown to invade brain tissue. sars-cov-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. studies suggest that sars-cov-2 can cause infection in the central nervous system (cns) and trigger neurological symptoms that include headache, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion and loss of smell or taste. based on our observations in vivo and in vitro , we hypothesize that sars-cov-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of chp weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the cns, causing neural damage in the young brain. in this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of sars-cov-2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus attacks multiple organs of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients, including the brain. besides pneumonia, it has been demonstrated that sars-cov-2 infection affects multiple organs, including brain tissues, causing different neurological manifestations, especially acute cerebrovascular disease (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke), impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. herein, we report a case of a 64-year old woman with covid19 infection who developed a pres, and we suggest that it could be explained by the disruption of the blood brain barrier induced by the cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction caused by sars-cov-2. therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether sars-cov-2 has access to the central nervous system and can cause direct neuronal effects. 
Disappointing that  stewards are heavy handed with COVID 19 masking rules, hot weather increases asthma symptoms which could potentially cause health problems for some masked spectators. PA announcements need to take people with exemptions into account!  #ENGvNZ [SEP] during the covid-19 pandemic, masking and hand hygiene are key to individual and public health. the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19) crisis has led governments to impose measures including mask wearing, physical distancing, and increased hygiene and disinfection, combined with home confinement and economic shutdown. for instance, mask wearing helps to reduce allergies as well as the transmission of other airborne disease-causing pathogens. so, should we recommend wearing a face mask to all during a pandemic of respiratory infectious disease (eg, covid-19) without any precautions or exemptions? mask wearing hesitancy is a concern during a respiratory viral disease pandemic. to understand the impact of the covid-19 epidemic on asthma control in children based on caregivers' perspectives and experiences. the covid-19 outbreak and the measures in response to it have had significant impacts on asthma control among children. to determine patterns of mask wearing and other infection prevention behaviours, over two time periods of the covid-19 pandemic, in cities where mask wearing was not a cultural norm. data were analysed according to the epidemiology of covid-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of covid-19 reduced mask wearing. 
  Tweeps did share #science when  atributed symptoms requiring urgent medical attention, to #TheCovidMyth that symptoms caused by being in close proximity to vaccinated person.  Symptoms could be fibroids, cervical/ovarian #cancer, menstrual disorders or #COVID19 https://t.co/a1CQiBaAMQ [SEP] they are commonly asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pressure symptoms. fast track referral is indicated for women with rapid onset and progressive symptoms or rapidly enlarging fibroids, as these symptoms are suspicious of leiomyosarcoma; postmenopausal women presenting with enlarging fibroids or vaginal bleeding; and women with fibroids with any other features of cancer e.g. most women never attribute or report any symptoms from their fibroids, and because of this the actual contribution of disease to symptoms of pelvic pain,menstrual symptoms, and infertility is poorly understood. fibroids may cause pain and menstrual bleeding to the point of anemia. women with ibd are at higher risk for cervical dysplasia compared to healthy controls with most cases preventable with vaccination. the main symptoms of uterine fibroids are profuse menstrual bleeding, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pressure symptoms. abdominal symptoms of pain, mass and distension were seen in patients with ovarian cancer (p<0.05). the majority of participants recognized symptoms of cervical cancer including inter-menstrual bleeding (85%), post-menopausal bleeding (84%), and offensive vaginal discharge (83%). recognition of cervical cancer risk factors and symptoms was high among study participants. targeted interventions including increasing availability of hpv vaccination, population-based cervical screening and diagnostic services can translate high awareness into actual benefits. 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/2AwZUDJlGn [SEP] various clinical features related to the central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns) due to covid-19 infection are now identified. recent studies show that covid-19 can directly or indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially causing neurological pathologies such as alzheimer disease and parkinson disease. thus, chronic covid-19-related disease processes have the potential to cause serious mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. these consequences may have serious social impacts on the future of covid-19 survivors. minor neurological symptoms such as anosmia are relatively common manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). here we present a case of a 66-year-old man with bipolar disorder and moderate respiratory covid-19 symptoms who presented to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness. the acute phase of covid-19 has been also related to nervous system symptoms, including loss of taste and smell as well as encephalitis and cerebrovascular disorders. this review article aims to give an overview of the current neurological symptoms associated with covid-19, as well as attempting to provide an insight beyond the acute affectation. epidemiological studies found that exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (pm) causes severe health problems in human and significant damage to the physiological systems. in recent days, pm exposure could be related as a carrier for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus transmission and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection. 
 What Pfizer or the CDC will not tell you is that the vaccine could cause every single symptom of COVID and you could lose a week+ of your life trying to recover from the things that’s suppose to “protect” you from COVID [SEP] mass vaccination with the pfizer-biontech coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccine (bnt162b2) in korea has resulted in many reported adverse effects. we report the case of a 29-year-old male who was diagnosed with myopericarditis after his second dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. to this end, we examined response to pfizer-biontech mrna vaccine in a large cohort of healthcare workers including those with versus without prior covid-19 infection. as of december 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine had been administered in the united states, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of pfizer biontech covid-19 vaccine had been submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). this report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine during december 14-23, 2020, in the united states. as of november 2, 2021, approximately 248 million doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine had been administered to persons aged ≥12 years in the united states. the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine has high efficacy (>90%) against covid-19 in children aged 5-11 years, and acip determined benefits outweigh risks for vaccination. clinicians should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following pfizer-biontech vaccination. here, we present the cases of three patients who developed lymphadenopathy after the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. on june 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis, acip determined that the benefits of using mrna covid-19 vaccines under the fda's eua clearly outweigh the risks in all populations, including adolescents and young adults. 
   the vaccine can cause heart and brain issues too...maybe even cancer. Its been giving women fertility issues. We won't know till like 10yrs down the road any other side effects of this which could be same or worse than just getting covid immunity naturally. Remember Pox Parties? [SEP] however, the development of a vaccine will help control the impact of covid-19. besides, revaccination with bcg can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. maybe bcg vaccine is effective in preventing covid-19 deaths or reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with poor health politics and assistance? covid-19 patients' clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic infection or flu like symptoms to serious pneumonia which could be associated with multiple organ failure possibly leading to death. meanwhile, this immune response may also lead to disease progression and could be responsible for the patient's death. the significant number of people who remain undecided about whether or not to get a covid-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies, is concerning. if successful, infection will usually lead to immunity, thus preventing infection later in life, which, for several vaccine-preventable diseases, is more severe than childhood infection. pox parties involve immediate risk of harm for children and reduce future harms, whereas opting out of vaccination places children at long-term risk of harms that increase with time, at least for some pathogens. the coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) pandemic is one of the most devastating things that happened in the world which has taken the lives of millions of people and has brutally shattered the world economy. this pandemic has instigated an urgent need for a vaccine to reduce the ongoing morbidity and mortality. 
5/ In other words, the authors (who work at Oxford, home of the  vaccine) appear to have wanted to prove Covid-19 was more likely to cause these clots than vaccines.  BUT THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MRNA VACCINES ARE NEARLY AS LIKELY TO CAUSE CLOTS AS THE DNA VACCINES... [SEP] although concerns regarding unusual blood clots and low platelet counts have been raised, the benefits of covid-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks of adverse events.what is the impact?except for children, the covid-19 vaccine is recommended for all people, including those pregnant or immunocompromised. introduction: concerns about the increased risk of blood clots associated with the vaxzevria (previously named oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine) and johnson & johnson (janssen) covid-19 vaccines raises the question of the thrombotic safety of other covid-19 vaccines such as pfizer-biontech or moderna, especially in younger women, who at the early stage of the pandemic was a priority group for vaccination. methods: using the us-based vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) and the fda event reporting system (faers), we retrieved cases of thrombosis following vaccinations or hormonal contraceptive use in women aged ≤ 50 years. conclusion: our results do support that, when compared to hormonal contraceptive use, the mrna vaccines do not show disproportional reporting of thromboembolic events in younger women. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. recent concerns have been raised regarding rare clotting events with the astrazeneca/oxford vaccine and it is currently unknown whether this risk is higher for those patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). this is a summary of a publication about the ensemble trial of the janssen ad26.cov2.s vaccine against covid-19, which was published in the new england journal of medicine in april 2021. blood clots, seizures, and tinnitus were very rare but were more common in the people who got the vaccine than in those who got the placebo. 
  COVID-19:[NEWLINE]1) directly causes viral pneumonia[NEWLINE]2) can create environment conducive to development of secondary bacterial pneumonia [NEWLINE]3) can result in intubation, creating risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia [SEP] the aim of this study is to determine whether severe covid-19 patients harbour a higher risk of icu-acquired pneumonia. icu-acquired pneumonia occurred in 52% of covid-19 patients, whereas in 26% and 23% of patients with bacterial or viral pneumonia, respectively (p < 0.001). covid-19 appears an independent risk factor of icu-acquired pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia. sars-cov-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a covid-19 patient as a complication. an essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with covid-19 in russia in march-may 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. reports of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) suggest that the covid-19 infection could itself cause pneumothorax in addition to the ventilator-induced trauma among mechanically ventilated patients. results primary viral pneumonia, and mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia, accounted for 90.3% and 9.7%, respectively, of covid-19-associated cap, with viral coinfection found in 30.5% of patients with primary viral pneumonia. viral pneumonia is commonly observed in covid-19 pandemic. the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic is associated with an unprecedented requirement for intensive care unit (icu) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and thereby significantly increasing the risk of secondary nosocomial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). covid-19 patients had increased risk of vap and mortality in comparison to other non-sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia (or=2.33; 95%ci 1.75-3.11; i2=15%, and or=1.46; 95%ci 1.15-1.86; i2=0% respectively). 
  now that we have that out of the way. yes, people can say that a heart attack is "covid-19", and they're probably wrong. then again, covid-19 can cause failure's in organs. and a heart attack could occur from that i think? she could have also had covid, and had a heart attack. [SEP] covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), which might attack not only the respiratory system, but also the other important organs, including the heart. it was reported that covid-19 patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases would have a higher mortality. though the virus predominantly affects the lungs, it can affect the heart in myriad ways. summary: covid-19 can affect the heart in many ways. this article describes the mechanisms, clinical presentations and management of heart failure caused by covid-19 infection. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) is a global pandemic with high infectivity and pathogenicity, accounting for tens of thousands of deaths worldwide. in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, covid-19 also causes heart failure (hf). covid-19-induced hf is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1β; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-α) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia. despite the respiratory complication, covid-19 is also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction, including severe cardiac impairment. emerging evidence reveals a direct interplay between covid-19 and dire cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure, heart attack, myocarditis, arrhythmias as well as blood clots, which are accompanied with elevated risk and adverse outcome among infected patients, even sudden death. 
I don’t think it’s that outlandish to assume that any lingering inflammation caused by covid infection would reignite briefly after the vaccine. Both cause a generalized inflammatory response. While vaccine can be more noticeable than the virus, it’s controlled & short-lived. 3/ [SEP] by the end of 2020, a year since the first cases of infection by the covid-19 virus have been reported; several pharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effective vaccines against the covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than 10^{6} people over the world. on the other hand, there is growing evidence of re-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. the effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. organ transplant recipients being at a risk for more severe covid-19 if they get sars cov-2 viral infection, covid-19 vaccine has a significant role in these patients. the vaccine is a safer way to help build protection and would either prevent covid-19 infection or at least diminish the severity of the disease. although most vaccinations are considered relatively safe, there may be adverse effects associated with any vaccine. shortly after, sars-cov-19 was identified as the responsible coronavirus for the heavy progress of the disease, which can manifest itself distinctively in different individuals. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) triggered a pandemic because of its high contagiousness before covid-19 associated symptoms actually appear. participants who expressed concerns about their health (p < 0.001), the requirement of mandatory covid-19 vaccination (p = 0.017), and their chronic disease status (p = 0.026) were independently associated with the acceptance of vaccination. conversely, participants presenting general vaccine refusal (p < 0.001), concerns about the serious side effects of covid-19 vaccines (p < 0.001), and those already thinking having an immune status to covid-19 (p = 0.008) were independently associated with covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. 
Ladies, you should know about this👉’ Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can cause temporary lymph node enlargement and result in a “false positive” mammogram’. 👈 we found this out the hard way. [SEP] enlargement of the injection site&rsquo;s draining lymph nodes is increasingly reported, but is not yet widely recognised as being possibly associated with recent vaccination. in this case series, we report on five patients who presented with enlarged lymph nodes after covid-19 vaccination. sonography guided fine needle aspiration (fna) was performed in five patients presenting with pet-positive and/or enlarged lymph nodes after covid-19 vaccination with either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccine. evidence of newly enlarged lymph nodes after recent covid-19 vaccination should be considered reactive in the first instance, occurring owing to stimulation of the immune system. a careful history of covid-19 vaccination and normal size and morphology of lymph node on unenhanced low-dose ct will aid the diagnosis. twenty-four patients (aged 33-76 years) with unilaterally enlarging lymph nodes on otherwise normal mammograms were identified in a review of mammographic reports from 1991 to 1995. enlarging lymph nodes on otherwise normal mammograms are usually benign. in a small number of people, an unexpected side effect of the covid-19 vaccine has emerged: swollen lymph nodes on the same side of the body as the shot was given. for women who undergo breast screening soon after vaccination, such swelling can show up on a mammogram, so clinicians may need to take extra steps to educate patients about this possibility and assess the need for follow-up testing. we report a case series of biopsy-proven reactive axillary lymph nodes, which were avid on fdg pet/ct in breast cancer patients post covid-19 vaccination. 
  Just b/c Covid-19 causes symptoms that look like the flu on the outside, we already know internal effects are different. How many kids & young people have silent cardiac damage? Can SARS-CoV-2 cause persistent or latent infection? (Google: persistent virus) [SEP] severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the cause coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). most individuals recover from sars-cov-2 infection, however, many continue to experience a cluster of persistent symptoms for months following resolution of acute disease; a syndrome that has been named long-covid. this review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused sars and mers to the novel sars-cov-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing covid-19. covid-19, caused by sars-cov-2 infection, is mild to moderate in the majority of previously healthy individuals, but can cause life-threatening disease or persistent debilitating symptoms in some cases. it is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of covid-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and like other coronaviruses, sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by a variety of symptoms including general flu-like symptoms such as a fever, sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath. the 2019 coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is a novel respiratory virus which causes coronavirus disease19 (covid-19). two patients were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 infection by rrt-pcr as covid-19 patients a and b. causative pathogens for included patients were detected using filmarray™ respiratory panel. currently, a novel strain of hcovs, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). sars-cov-2 infects the respiratory tract causing flu-like symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death. 
 Rubbish! this is all based on a flawed testing method that produces false positive results! Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] the total coronavirus disease (covid-19) cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection have reached 139 million worldwide and nearing 3 million deaths on april 16, 2021. it will help a better early detection of the disease that will eventually reduce the mortality rate of covid. covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel beta-coronavirus that is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has become a global pandemic. as rapid and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 is required to control the spread of this infectious disease, the current study evaluated three commercially available assays, including the taqpath covid-19 combo kit, the cobas® sars-cov-2 test and the rendu 2019-ncov assay kit, to establish diagnostic algorithms for clinical laboratories. a manual test-based testing strategy combining the t-cdc method and the taqpath covid-19 combo kit was developed, which demonstrated excellent concordance rates (>99%) with the cobas and rendu automatic systems. background: covid-19 is a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus strain. innovative tests have been developed to diagnose and characterize the spread of covid-19. on 11 march 2020, the world health organization declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a pandemic. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic respiratory infection caused by a new betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). 
   SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Though COVID-19 can cause this, the condition COVID-19 infection resulting in ICU admission with respiratory support is more accurately called ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] bc it results in alveolar injury. #My$0.02 [SEP] covid-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). fourteen days after the second dose of the vaccine, a 66-year-old male patient with a negative covid-19 pcr test result and high levels of igg and low levels of igm-a against sars-cov-2 was admitted to our intensive care unit (icu) due to the clinical picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). the patient experienced a rapid decline in respiratory function and was intubated in the intensive care unit (icu), meeting the berlin criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). pathologic examination revealed massive bilateral alveolar damage, indicating early-phase "acute respiratory distress syndrome" (ards). disseminated lung injury with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is the main cause of mortality in covid-19. severe coronavirus 2019 disease (covid-19) represents viral pneumonia from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is a common complication of severe covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) caused by sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) causes severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) which can lead to difficulty breathing. after inhalation, aerosols containing sars-cov-2 penetrate to the depths of the lungs and cause severe pneumonia, alveolar injury, and life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). sars-cov-2 infection can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), septic shock, and/or organ failure. 
        (continued) as well as pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as diabetes and obesity ( here ).  SO, I will add, if someone had asthma and managed it their whole life then gets Covid and dies,  the Covid is what caused The death. [SEP] older age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were risk factors for infection, complications, and death from covid-19. thus, not only are patients with metabolic dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe covid-19 but also infection with sars-cov-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing metabolic disorders. growing numbers of reports have connected obesity to more severe covid-19 illness and death. our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to covid-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. we therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of covid-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death. a high burden of severe disease and death from the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been consistently observed in older patients, especially those with pre-existing medical co-morbidities. out of 1930 deaths from covid-19 infections, 733 deaths were due to obesity alone in patients without reported comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to covid-19, it has also been shown that covid-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. this review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse covid-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and finally, obesity. individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of covid-19. 
So the second dose for the covid shot can cause something called covid arm? I totally could use a third arm. You do know where those fingers will be all day? Yep, on Twitter while I work. I bet you thought something else.  *it's about hives and not a 3rd arm [SEP] the coronavirus pandemic (covid-19) has served as a call-to-arms in preparing practices for the next disaster whether it is another infectious disease or a flood, hurricane, earthquake, a sustained power outage, or something else. in the setting of the raging covid-19 pandemic, the search for innovative therapeutics is desperately sought after. as we learn more about the characteristics and metabolic health of patients and as our understanding of covid-19 pathophysiology and treatment progresses, so is our understanding of medication effects that might increase disease severity. in the phase i trial, 18 patients with covid-19-related pneumonia and/or lymphopenia with no oxygen requirement or with an oxygen need of ≤ 2.5 liters per minute (lpm) in nasal cannula will be assigned to two arms, based on the biology of the donor and the patient. treatment of arm a consists of the administration of escalating doses of memory t cells, plus standard of care (soc). treatment of arm b consists of the administration of escalating doses of nk cells, plus soc. in the phase ii trial, a total of 182 patients with covid-19-related pneumonia and/or lymphopenia requiring or not oxygen supplementation but without mechanical ventilation will be allocated to arm a or b, considering hla typing. in arm a, patients will receive soc or rp2d for memory t cells plus the soc. in arm b, patients will receive soc or rp2d for nk cells plus the soc. on further review of the patient's history, she had received her second shot of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine approximately 2 days before the restaging pet/ct scan. 
     How can cardiovascular damage be anecdotal? I believe the science is showing that Covid can cause long term effects. It is the second cause of death. This virus can not be wished away no matter how strong minded you are. [SEP] covid-19 can significantly affect patients' cardiovascular systems. first, those with covid-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. mortality from covid-19 is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. understanding the effects of covid-19 on the cardiovascular system is essential for providing comprehensive medical care for cardiac and/or covid-19 patients. we hereby review the literature on covid-19 regarding cardiovascular virus involvement. pre-existing cardiovascular disease (cvd) increases the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 and is strongly associated with poor disease outcomes. the long-term cardiac complications associated with covid-19 are incompletely characterised and thought to include hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure. the aim of this review was to summarise the current evidence of the acute and long-term cardiovascular consequences of sars-cov-2 infection and the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 may cause cardiovascular disease. in the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/covid cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-covid-19 sequelae. although clinical manifestations of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic (covid-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), are mainly respiratory symptoms, patients can also develop severe cardiovascular damage. 
Another “deadly variant” that coincidentally attacks 12& younger right when needing Covid-19 Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA when vaccines are causing blood-clots, heart attacks & heart inflammation. Keep in mind heart disease/ failure is the #1 cause of death in U.S🤡🌎 https://t.co/1QyOgbSgYM [SEP] in december 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued emergency use authorizations (euas) for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 (bnt162b2) vaccine and the moderna covid-19 (mrna-1273) vaccine,† and the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued interim recommendations for their use in persons aged ≥16 years and ≥18 years, respectively.§ in may 2021, fda expanded the eua for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine to include adolescents aged 12-15 years; acip recommends that all persons aged ≥12 years receive a covid-19 vaccine. after reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mrna vaccine recipients,¶ which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an acip meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mrna covid-19 vaccination in the united states. the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), an infectious disease with severe acute respiratory syndrome, has now become a worldwide pandemic. emerging evidence reveals a direct interplay between covid-19 and dire cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure, heart attack, myocarditis, arrhythmias as well as blood clots, which are accompanied with elevated risk and adverse outcome among infected patients, even sudden death. in this comprehensive review, we aimed to highlight the current integrated therapeutic approaches for covid-19 and we summarized the potential therapeutic options, currently under clinical trials, with their mechanisms of action and associated adverse cardiac events in highly infectious covid-19 patients. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is a global crisis, with devastating health, business and social impacts. however, covid-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) causes a pandemic around the globe. therefore, covid-19 may cause right heart dysfunction by inducing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. here, we reported a 32-year-old male presenting to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) diagnosis. 
I have issues with thrombosis & embolisms and stuff and tbh I'm more afraid to get the virus than anything b/c covid is known to cause really bad inflammation,  hypercoagulation, clots etc. Much rather be vaccinated. Better odds. [SEP] thromboembolism in covid 19 infection is attributed to injury to the vascular endothelial cell, hypercoagulability and blood stasis. covid 19 infected patients with pre-existing hypercoagulable disorders have higher risk of developing thrombosis and thromboembolism and such thrombotic episodes may prove to be severely morbid in these patients. such side effect of covid 19 vaccine in patients of hypercoagulable disorder may prove to be fatal. the patients should also be health educated regarding side effects of vaccine especially with those indicating thrombosis and they should be warranted to receive immediate medical care in case of any side effects or complications. coronavirus disease of 2019 (covid-19) is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2, which is characterized by a multitude of clinical abnormalities, including hypercoagulability. although thrombosis is commonly observed in sepsis, the hypercoagulable state associated with covid-19 is much more dramatic and may not be related to either the severity of the disease or the d-dimer levels. hypercoagulability has been found in patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus 19 (covid-19) and has been identified as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. the aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (covid-19) patients, including risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to evaluate the need for rehabilitation to prevent pulmonary embolism. we recommend anticoagulant therapy and early rehabilitation intervention to prevent pulmonary embolism in covid-19 patients. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). 
Percentage of total cancer deaths are 21.3%.and you're worried about COVID-19?[NEWLINE]Race & sex also play a role in a person’s risk of developing cancer, depending on the type. That said, lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer in both men & women. [SEP] lung cancer is the leading cancer that causes premature death in canadian men, and it is the second leading cancer that causes death in canadian women. although the absolute increase in lung cancer is greater in men, the percentage of increase is greater in women, especially in the younger age groups. the leading cancer death was lung cancer in men and pancreatic cancer in women. the lifetime risk of developing cancer is 44.8 percent for men and 39.3 percent for women. for both sexes, the risk of dying of lung cancer is higher than for any other cancer. we measured age-, sex-, and race-specific rates (per 100,000 person-years at risk) of death from lung cancer among more than 940,000 adults who reported no history of smoking at enrollment in either of two large american cancer society cancer prevention study cohorts during 1959-1972 (cps-i) and 1982-2000 (cps-ii). increasing lung cancer deaths amongst women alongside stable or decreasing deaths amongst men in many countries have substantially altered the male:female ratio in this disease and produced a need to understand differences between men and women in lung cancer risk, and how they relate to sex and gender. this paper reviews research on differences between men and women in lung cancer incidence, mortality and survival, focusing on material which adds to our understanding of the complex differences between each group. in particular women's apparently greater relative risk of lung cancer and the differences between men and women in the risk of specific histological types of lung cancer need to be understood from a perspective in which both biological influences and gender influences are drawn out. lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the united states, accounting for more cancer deaths since 1930 than all other cancer deaths combined. 
  Covid is turning out to be a vascular virus with respiratory symptoms. Covid causes heart failure and heart attacks. [SEP] in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, covid-19 also causes heart failure (hf). covid-19-induced hf is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1β; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-α) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia. cardiovascular wellbeing has been dramatically affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2), the reason for the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. from cardiovascular point of view, wide spectrum of manifestations including subclinical myocardial injury, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombus formation in cardiac chambers and vascular bed has been reported in covid-19 disease. heart failure (hf) is one such complication caused by the virus, both in patients with and without cardiovascular diseases. summary: covid-19 can affect the heart in many ways. this article describes the mechanisms, clinical presentations and management of heart failure caused by covid-19 infection. covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), which might attack not only the respiratory system, but also the other important organs, including the heart. it was reported that covid-19 patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases would have a higher mortality. coronavirus disease (covid-19) is a severe infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) that binds to the cells; angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect. https://t.co/NJQ1EbxP2I [SEP] evidence is emerging that taste and smell loss are common symptoms of covid-19 that may emerge and persist long after initial infection. in this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in covid-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. this study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with covid-19 infection. this article provides an overview of olfactory loss and the recent findings relating to covid-19. this should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during covid-19 pandemic, and further highlights the value of loss of sense of smell and taste as a marker of infection. background: smell and taste dysfunctions are common and have been reported as an early indicator of covid-19. conclusions: evidence suggests that smell or taste dysfunctions were common among children with covid-19. since the initial anecdotal reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) from china, a growing number of studies have reported on smell and/or taste dysfunction (std). analysis stratified by severity of std showed that more than half of covid-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. many patients with clinically diagnosed covid-19 report an affected sense of smell and taste. 
‘We made a big mistake’ — COVID vaccine spike protein travels from injection site, can cause organ damage https://t.co/i1nZiEhmiX [SEP] the urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of sars-cov-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. it is concluded that ace2+ endothelial damage is a central part of sars-cov2 pathology and may be induced by the spike protein alone. the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 imposes an urgent need for rapid development of an efficient and cost-effective vaccine, suitable for mass immunization. here, we show the development of a replication competent recombinant vsv-∆g-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of vsv is replaced by the spike protein of sars-cov-2. in-vitro characterization of this vaccine indicates the expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to sars-cov-2. taken together, we suggest the recombinant vsv-∆g-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against sars-cov-2. in this review, we summarize the current epidemiological status of covid-19 and consider the virological and immunological lessons, animal models, and tools developed in response to prior sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks that can serve as resources for development of sars-cov-2 therapeutics and vaccines. in particular, we discuss structural insights into the sars-cov-2 spike protein, a major determinant of transmissibility, and discuss key molecular aspects that will aid in understanding and fighting this new global threat. the urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of sars-cov-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. until today, covid-19, which not only causes life-threatening lung infections but also impairs various other organs and tissues, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused irreparable damage to many others. 
Covid seems to wake up the same age-old mechanism in our white blood cells that causes long-term brain and nerve inflammation in multiple sclerosis (an ancient virus that has become part of our DNA). It could explain why certain people get neurological #LongCovid symptoms 🤕 https://t.co/5wnIuiQveQ [SEP] neurological manifestations of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) are reported to occur in as much as 37% of the affected patients. due to the infection by the sars-cov-2 virus (covid-19) there were also reported neurological symptoms, being the most frequent and best cited those that affect the cerebrovascular, sensorial, cognitive and motor functions, together with the neurological diffuse symptoms as for examples headache or dizziness. therefore, the aim of this review is to provide summarized information about the neurological symptomatology and the brain pathogenic mechanisms involved and reported in covid-19. anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between sars-cov2 and covid-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. the neurological symptoms of a covid-19 infection in the brain are mainly due to either the entry of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the nervous system or the production of these cytokines by microglia and astrocytes. manifestation of neurological symptoms in certain patients of coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) has warranted for their virus-induced etiogenesis. the neurological symptoms in covid-19 may also arise as a consequence of the "cytokine storm" (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co-morbidities. ever since the first reported case series on sars-cov-2-induced neurological manifestation in wuhan, china in april 2020, various studies reporting similar as well as diverse symptoms of covid-19 infection relating to the nervous system were published. for this review, articles pertaining information on the neurological manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection were gathered from pubmed and google scholar using the search keywords "sars-cov-2", "covid-19", and "neurological dysfunction". 
 Yes! Oral contraceptives cause more blood clots and nobody is doing anything about that!!! Like 1 per 1,000 compared to basically 1 per MILLION with the Covid vaccine. Maddening. [SEP] introduction: concerns about the increased risk of blood clots associated with the vaxzevria (previously named oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine) and johnson & johnson (janssen) covid-19 vaccines raises the question of the thrombotic safety of other covid-19 vaccines such as pfizer-biontech or moderna, especially in younger women, who at the early stage of the pandemic was a priority group for vaccination. methods: using the us-based vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) and the fda event reporting system (faers), we retrieved cases of thrombosis following vaccinations or hormonal contraceptive use in women aged ≤ 50 years. results: on 19 march 2021, out of 13.6 million women aged ≤ 50 exposed to at least one dose of pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines in the us, only 61 cases were reported with a total of 68 thromboembolic events (1 case per 222,951 vaccinated). conclusion: our results do support that, when compared to hormonal contraceptive use, the mrna vaccines do not show disproportional reporting of thromboembolic events in younger women. the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). oral contraceptive pills have been associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. the estimated risk of venous thromboembolism attributable to oral contraceptive pills is less than 3 per 10,000 women per year. oral contraceptives increase the risk of venous thrombosis, with the extent depending on the dose of ethinylestradiol and the type of progestin: the risk is about 20 cases per 100,000 woman-years with norethisterone or levonorgestrel and less than 50 microgrammes of ethinylestradiol, and 30 to 40 cases per 100,000 woman-years with gestodene or desogestrel. a case-control study conducted in the netherlands that included 1524 patients and 1760 controls showed a statistically significant 6-fold increase in the risk of thrombosis among women using combinations containing drospirenone compared to women who did not use oral contraception, and a non-significant 1.7-fold increase compared to women using combinations based on levonorgestrel. 
  Vaccines allow you to build immunity without suffering the damaging effects of the disease itself. COVID-19 can cause serious long-term health problems and even be fatal. All of this can be avoided by getting vaccinated.  https://t.co/segNhg4ePd [SEP] vaccines against sars-cov-2 still represent the most effective weapon to combat the circulation of the virus, in order to decrease the impact of covid-19 on the general health of the population, to prevent the emergence of new sars-cov-2 variants and avoid excessive hospitalization. our main objective is to focus attention on four main elements in support of vaccination strategy in order to promote the patients' awareness to be at highest risk of negative consequences in case of sars-cov-2 infection, and to build, strengthen and maintain trust in vaccines' efficacy and safety. since the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) was declared a pandemic, there was no doubt that vaccination is the ideal protocol to tackle it. finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that covid-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. the present study confirmed that the authorized covid-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. a covid-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus, and effective vaccines are going to be available in the near future. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has represented an unprecedented challenge for humankind from health, economic, and social viewpoints. the current pandemic of covid-19 has set off an urgent search for an effective vaccine. these animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against covid-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. vaccines are considered the most powerful measure to fight the pandemic and protect people from covid-19. 
   immunity escape you talk about is not proven concerning the effect of this vaccin. Which is proved is it's his high  %age of efficiency against covid and which is certain is that covid is a mortal virus which also can cause severe after effects if you don t die. [SEP] in the current article, we try to elucidate various causes behind covid-19 infection and mortality following covid-19 vaccination and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. epidemiology, risk factors, adverse events following immunization (aefi) and mortality after covid-19 vaccination were assessed. four sars-cov-2 variants of concern including b.1.1.7, b.1.351, b.1.617.2, and p.1, and two variants of interest including c.37 and b.1.621 have been reported to have potential immune escape, and one or more mutations endow them with worrisome epidemiologic, immunologic, or pathogenic characteristics. in the end, sars-cov-2 evolution strategies in different transmission stages, the impact of different vaccination strategies on sars-cov-2 immune escape, antibody therapy strategies and covid-19 epidemic control prospects are discussed. this review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the secret of sars-cov-2 variants of interest/concern and immune escape. objective: the purpose of the present report was to address the global burden of these six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children < 5 years of age, together with implications for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection in children. methods: the current immunization strategies for the prevention of the six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children are reviewed as a framework for new strategies of vaccine prevention of covid-19 in children. herein, we discuss the potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions including repurposed drugs and the newly developed/approved vaccines, highlighting the impact of virus evolution on the immune evasion of the virus from currently licensed vaccines for covid-19. global vaccine control of the pandemic depends in great measure on our ability to keep up with current and future immune escape variants of the virus. here, the potentially preventive immunologic effects of bcg and influenza vaccination are compared with the immune response defects caused by aging and covid-19. 
 So what? COVID-19 is thousands of times more likely to be fatal or cause long term effects. This is a global crisis and war on a virus. People need to calibrate their thinking a little. This obsession with minute vaccine risks is dangerous and unethical. [SEP] the most favorable epidemic control scenario, which provides long-term protection against covid-19 outbreak, is the development and distribution of an effective and safe vaccine. besides, the fact that obtaining vaccines faster through deliberate infection studies of healthy people has greater benefits than risks, has been demonstrated by obtaining other vaccines in other historical pandemics such as: smallpox, influenza, malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever and zika. accelerating the development of a covid-19 vaccine even for a few weeks or months would have a great beneficial impact on public health by saving many lives. the covid-19 pandemic has suddenly and deeply changed our lives in a way comparable with the most traumatic events in history, such as a world war. the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has disrupted immunization programs around the globe, potentially increasing life-threatening vaccine-preventable diseases. the outbreak of corona virus in late december 2019 (also known as covid-19) raised major concerns when the outbreak started getting tremendous. given the increasing number of deaths, the covid-19 has caused havoc worldwide and is a matter of serious concern. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus has affected the health of tens of millions of people worldwide. vaccines are considered the most powerful measure to fight the pandemic and protect people from covid-19. the outbreak of covid-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. 
  And yes they’re included in the numbers. Covid causes inflammation in your circulatory system which can lead to things like blood clots and heart attacks. [SEP] infection by sars-cov-2 produces significant pulmonary pathology including endothelial damage with resultant thrombotic events. studying (ultra)structural features of the autopsy lung samples from patients with covid-19 has provided evidence for a pathogenic link between inflammation and thrombosis. the major features in the lungs of covid-19 patients comprised primary inflammatory thrombosis associated with diffuse alveolar damage. multiple lines of evidence have shown that elevated blood troponin is strongly associated with poor prognosis in patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). possible mechanisms of myocardial injury in covid-19 include ischaemia due to circulatory and respiratory failure, epicardial or intramyocardial small coronary artery thrombotic obstruction due to increased coagulability, and myocarditis caused by systemic inflammation or direct binding of the virus to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ace2), which is abundantly expressed in the heart. emerging evidence reveals a direct interplay between covid-19 and dire cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure, heart attack, myocarditis, arrhythmias as well as blood clots, which are accompanied with elevated risk and adverse outcome among infected patients, even sudden death. covid-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and death. evidence suggests a correlation between infection with many virus types and development of clotting-related symptoms, ranging from heart disease to bleeding, depending on the virus. to reveal if coagulopathies relate to the course of covid-19, we examined 255 patients with moderate and severe covid-19, receiving anticoagulants and immunosuppressive drugs. the results obtained (i) confirm the importance of hemostatic disorders in covid-19 and their relation to systemic inflammation; (ii) justify monitoring of hemostasis, including the kinetics of blood clot contraction; (iii) substantiate the active prophylaxis of thrombotic complications in covid-19. 
From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #LongCovid  https://t.co/ydwF4NAbIW [SEP] critical illness and the associated interventions have a detrimental impact on the microbiome. if similar processes are present in humans, the effects of enteric virus infections might have longer-term impacts extending beyond the directly observed symptoms. dysfunction of the gut microbiome can be caused by short-term (virus infection and other infectious diseases) or long-term (environment, nutrition, and stress) factors. here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (covid-19). the coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the raas. in december 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown etiology was reported which caused panic in wuhan city of central china, which was later identified as coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) and who. to date, the sars-cov-2 spread has already become a global pandemic with a considerable death toll. the associated symptoms of the covid-19 infection varied with increased inflammation as an everyday pathological basis. among various other symptoms such as fever, cough, lethargy, gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms included diarrhea and ibd with colitis, have been reported. based on the available related literature, which documented gi symptoms with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) with colitis, and increased deaths in the intensive care unit (icu), conclude that dysbiosis occurs during sars-cov-2 infection as the gut-lung axis cannot be ignored. 
If you’ve had COVID, your first vaccine dose may cause worse side effects. Here’s why https://t.co/NENybrfQbp [SEP] side effects of vaccines are common, but people react differently to different vaccines. our survey results show that the side effects of the first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine are more common than after the first and second doses of the pfizer vaccine. the respondents were asked about the side effects after the first and second doses of the vaccines, such as injection site pain, arm pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, and fatigue. however, severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be dangerous, and they engender fear. this study shows that the first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine causes side effects more often than either dose of the pfizer vaccine. side effects post first vaccine dose of normal injection site pain, fatigue and headache were more common in participants aged ≤49 years versus >49 years, while pain at the vaccination site, fatigue, lethargy, headache and tenderness were the most common side effects post second dose in both groups. the benefits of covid-19 vaccination currently outweigh the side effect profile and are recommended as the first-line approach to control the current pandemic. with rapid and extensive administration of inactivated coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccine to the general population in china, it is crucial for clinicians to recognize neurological complications or other side effects associated with covid-19 vaccination. coronavirus disease (covid-19) vaccine-related side effects have a determinant role in the public decision regarding vaccination. covast is the first independent study aiming to monitor the side effects of covid-19 vaccines following booster doses, and the long-term safety and effectiveness of said vaccines. 
  See this please to get the seriousness of the matter at hand. Dr Mark Gordon has a good idea of what Long Covid is and compares it to brain injury caused by explosions. This is brain inflammation and damage. Don’t work through it. Strokes, fits...etc. [NEWLINE]https://t.co/sQAcI3MnoU [SEP] stroke induces a highly complex web of pathophysiology that usually leads to serious long-term -disability. damps are known to cause massive inflammation and brain damage. one of the most serious early clinical complications of cerebral ischaemia is brain oedema, which compromises survival in the first 24-48 h. it is not understood whether systemic inflammatory challenges impair outcome after stroke by increasing brain injury only or whether they have direct effects on brain oedema, cerebrovascular inflammation and blood-brain barrier damage. our results suggest that systemic inflammatory conditions induce cerebrovascular inflammation via diverse mechanisms. stroke, trauma, anoxia, infection etc). the developing brain is very susceptible to environmental insults, and very immature infants often suffer from long-term neurological syndromes associated with white matter injuries such as periventricular leukomalacia. these co-morbidities (atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, infection) have a strong inflammatory component, supporting the need for greater understanding of how inflammation contributes to acute brain injury. recent literature supporting this and other aspects of how il-1 and systemic inflammation in general contribute to acute brain injury are discussed in this review. inflammation in the cns predominantly involves microglia and macrophages, and is believed to be a significant cause of secondary injury following trauma. traumatic injuries of the brain and spinal cord are a significant source of mortality and long-term disability. 
Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt told Parliament that not one life had been lost to Covid this year.  With ZERO DEATHS as the benchmark, it's hard to defend a vaccine that's been the cause of 2 deaths in the same period. #DeathByVaccine #COVID #AZdeath https://t.co/JVdvpIMkIO [SEP] the burden of disease arising from covid-19 can be expressed as the number of years of life lost to disease or death. 305 641 years of life were lost to covid-19 in germany in 2020. the daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for covid-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. persons who died of covid-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. the burden of disease arising from covid-19 can be expressed as the number of years of life lost to disease or death. 305 641 years of life were lost to covid-19 in germany in 2020. the daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for covid-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. persons who died of covid-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. as of october 2020, there are >1 million documented deaths with covid-19. simulations are presented with a total of 1.58-8.76 million covid-19 deaths over 5-years (1/2020-12/2024) globally (0.5-2.9% of total global deaths). 
  So sorry for your loss. Even the J&J is way less likely to cause serious side effects than COVID. There’s a risk for sure w/any of the vaccines, but for the majority of Americans (w/o an allergy to ingredients in vaccine &no autoimmune disorders), the risk is way less than COVID. [SEP] the most prevalent reasons against covid-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. unprecedented loss of life due to the covid pandemic has necessitated the development of several vaccines in record time. the potential harmful side effects of a covid-19 vaccine was the main reason for vaccine hesitancy. the incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (rcts) demonstrating that covid-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. for the first time, our study links prior covid-19 illness with an increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mrna vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects but more local reactions. there is growing evidence that not only the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) but also the covid-19 vaccines can cause a variety of skin reactions. vaccination is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting a person against covid-19. however, covid-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. herein we present current considerations regarding the covid-19 vaccines including: efficacy against new variants, challenges in distribution, disparities in availability, dosage gender and race difference, covid-19 vaccine transport and storage, limitations in children and pregnant women. 
           I believe mine was a fibro flare caused from vaccine. It’s been 13 days since vaccine & Tim’s just now getting sick. So not sure what’s going on with him. Either a stomach virus - there’s one going around or Covid cause it takes 2-4 weeks after vaccine to be fully immune. [SEP] concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the primary reported reasons for not getting vaccinated. normally vaccine development takes 10-15 years but vaccine development against sars-cov2 is going on at a very fast pace resulting in almost breakthrough methods of vaccine development by several research institutions. the current review highlights the different approaches and technologies used around the world for the design and development of the vaccines and also focuses on the recent status of the sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates under development by various institutions to combat the world threat of covid-19 pandemic. in most people, the vaccine started working after about 2 weeks. after receiving the vaccine, some people experienced pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, and nausea. in most cases, these were mild and went away within a few days. at the time of the study, it was not clear if these were caused by the vaccine or not. covid-19 vaccine breakthrough infection surveillance helps monitor trends in disease incidence and severe outcomes in fully vaccinated persons, including the impact of the highly transmissible b.1.617.2 (delta) variant of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. both food and drug administration and european medicines agency have recently approved the first covid-19 vaccines, and a few more are going to be approved soon. since vaccinations campaigns started in december 2020 in both the us and europe, gastroenterologists will be one of the main sources of information regarding sars-cov 2 vaccination for patients in their practice, including vulnerable patients such as those with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), patients with chronic liver disease, and gi cancer patients. 
      Incorrect. Vaccine do not normally cause blood clots. Nor do viruses...SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccine do.  We cannot ignore this. We can rationally protect ourselves from harm. [SEP] vaccines are needed to protect from sars-cov-2, the virus causing covid-19. in march 2021 germany limited the use of the oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine to people 60 years of age and older due to concerns that it may be causing blood clots. the possibility of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement with coronavirus vaccines has been flagged as a potential safety concern, and, despite the urgent need, should be thoroughly assessed as vaccines against sars-cov-2 are being tested. we review the in vivo evidence suggesting a theoretical risk of disease enhancement after vaccination with sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine candidates. while the pressing need for a vaccine against covid-19 (and future epidemic coronaviruses) cannot be ignored, we advocate to keep safety at the center of the debate. we found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with sars-cov-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against covid-19. transmission-blocking vaccines are urgently needed to reduce transmission of sars-cov 2, the cause of the covid-19 pandemic. although there has historically been concern that vaccines may trigger disease flares of sle, there is little convincing evidence to show this. recent concerns have been raised regarding rare clotting events with the astrazeneca/oxford vaccine and it is currently unknown whether this risk is higher for those patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. as mass vaccination programmes begin to roll out across the world, we assess the evidence of the use of vaccines in sle patients and in particular vaccines targeting sars-cov-2. 
  Of course it is - my own mothers lungs where so damaged by Covid it caused Covid-pneumonitis in which the lungs inflame and cause more damage, it took 2 months until her lungs barely functioning which led to her death, this was caused by Covid therefore the caused by Covid... [SEP] infection with sars-cov-2 is causing a deadly and pandemic disease called coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19). it was soon discovered that the disease was caused by a novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2, and the disease was thus abbreviated to covid-19 (covid). what is worse, there are reasons to believe that fibrosis may become one of the major long-term complications of covid, even in asymptomatic individuals. the autopsies revealed characteristic covid-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs, which were regarded as the cause of death in most patients. it may also be a cause of persistent lung damage in patients who recover from severe covid-19. the covid-19 viral infection in the most severe cases can cause severe lung lesions with the presence of ﬁbrotic tissue. covid-19 not only causes lung injury, but there may also be an involvement of other organs, including the cardiovascular system. to clarify the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 caused lung inflammation and injury, from the molecular mechanism to lung damage and tissue repair, from research to clinical practice, and then presented clinical requirements. respiratory failure is the major cause of death in coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). we report the course of covid-19 in paired biopsy specimens and autopsies, illustrating vascular, organizing, and fibrotic patterns of covid-19-induced lung injury. 
 There is a round of coronavirus cold every fall and winter, so 93% of people are immune to -ncov. Immunity is achieved through lymphocytes. After 2019-ncov infection, lymphocytes were depleted. Antipyretics and corticosteroids suppress lymphocyte immunity and cause COVID-19. [SEP] immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-ncov pneumonia. the corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by novel coronavirus 2019-ncov-2, leading to subsequent pulmonary interstitial fibrosis with chronic inflammatory changes, e.g., inflammatory factors repeatedly continuously stimulating and attacking the alveolar epithelial cells. additionally, the immune system in 2019-ncov-2 infected cases can be suppressed to cause tumor immune evasion. an outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection is now widespread in multiple countries. the characteristic clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of elderly patients support their excessive inflammation and weak immune defenses against 2019-ncov. in december 2019, a cluster of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), emerged in wuhan, hubei province, china. moreover, immunity can be boosted against 2019-ncov by regular exercise. the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), has become a global threat. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, alzheimer's, etc. a continuing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was initially described in wuhan, china in december 2019. 
 Oh well! This is all based on a flawed testing method that produces false positive results! Deaths that have been reclassified as covid regardless of the actual cause, and a 99.9% recovery rate! #Plandemic #Agenda21 #ID2020 #Operationlockstep #Quantumtattoo #Coronavirus #Covid19 [SEP] direct and indirect covid19-related mortality is uncertain. theoretically covid19-excluded subjects (pcr-negative) suffered ten-times greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-covid19 subjects, which points to the existence of considerable number of false negative results in earlier pcr testing and could explain part of the global excess all-cause mortality observed during the pandemic. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has become a global pandemic. the total coronavirus disease (covid-19) cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection have reached 139 million worldwide and nearing 3 million deaths on april 16, 2021. covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel beta-coronavirus that is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. background: covid-19 is a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus strain. innovative tests have been developed to diagnose and characterize the spread of covid-19. unfortunately, during current covid-19 testing procedures, about 30% of tests are associated with a false-negative result. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic respiratory infection caused by a new betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). for informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), they need to be very accurate. 
 If u have had covid u don’t need the vaccine it can cause problems by adding more antibodies to ur other antibiotics that devel in ur body from having the virus [SEP] to investigate whether unilateral or bilateral uncinate resection (ur) combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (acdf) increases the risk of pseudarthrosis at long-term follow-up. as uncovertebral joints are important for maintaining stability, they may affect the fusion process by causing segmental instability if resected during acdf. we retrospectively examined 167 patients (89 men, 78 women; mean age, 58.4 ± 10.5 yr) who consecutively underwent single- or double-level acdf and were followed for >2 years. hence, if necessary, additional ur can be performed during acdf without concern regarding nonunion. ur did not alter the cl of dfur, but reduced the absorption rate of dfur from the gastrointestinal tract and significantly reduced the absolute oral bioavailability of dfur from 55.2% to 33.4%. recombinant adenoviruses (ad) are being explored as promising delivery systems for gene therapy and vaccination. however, there is a concern about the possibility of generating replication-competent adenoviruses (rca) using the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. we first constructed a shuttle plasmid which encodes the e1a/e1b sequence that is necessary for adenovirus replication. viruses produced in ur cells were still rca-free after ten test passages, while adenovirus produced in 293 cells had generated rca during the fourth passage. in every case where presumptive ureteral stone was not found, a formal nephroscopy as well as a whole collecting system revision was completed. 
  COVID-19 causes inflammation throughout vtge body, including the brain. Inflammation has been implicated as an underlying cause for depression and is a known cause for dementia. [SEP] alzheimer's disease (ad) has emerged as a key comorbidity of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). meanwhile, covid-19 has also been reported to cause various neurologic symptoms including cognitive impairment that may ultimately result in ad, probably through the invasion of sars-cov-2 into the central nervous system, covid-19-induced inflammation, long-term hospitalization and delirium, and post-covid-19 syndrome. we also highlight the influence of covid-19 on cognitive function, and propose possible routes of viral invasion into the brain and potential mechanisms underlying the covid-19-induced cognitive impairment. last, we summarize the negative impacts of covid-19 pandemic on uninfected ad patients and dementia prevention. due to the neurological symptoms associated with covid-19, damage in the central nervous system has been suggested as well as the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov-2. it is known that cov infections are associated with an inflammation process related to the imbalance of the antioxidant system; cellular changes caused by oxidative stress contribute to brain tissue damage. chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because covid-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. recent investigations have revealed that a cytokine storm contributes to brain inflammation and subsequently triggers neurological manifestations during the covid-19 outbreak. furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by covid-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet. covid-19 can cause severe neurological symptoms, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear. 
So kind of a bad choice when your target for the vaccine can cause side effects in its own right.  Still this vaccine has been a huge net positive but hopefully the he next generation of covid vaccines finds something a little less harmful as the target https://t.co/Efos6smnvg [SEP] acceptance of covid-19 vaccine among health-care workers (hcws) is crucial for controlling the pandemic and ensuring hcw and patient safety. reasons for taking the vaccine were concerns for families contracting covid-19 (67%) and social responsibility (64%). introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic continues to spread worldwide and vaccination remains the most effective approach to control covid-19. finally, we discuss the challenges of covid-19 vaccines and opportunities for the bcg vaccine. enormous hope in the efficacy of vaccines became recently a successful reality in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic. here, we review the unknowns of the covid-19 vaccination, such as its longevity, asymptomatic spread, long-term side effects, and its efficacy on immunocompromised patients. despite all these challenges and the fact that the end of the covid-19 pandemic is still unclear, vaccines have brought great hope for the world, with several reports indicating a significant decline in the risk of covid19-related infection and hospitalizations. unprecedented loss of life due to the covid pandemic has necessitated the development of several vaccines in record time. shortly after the 2020 us election, initial evidence on first-generation covid-19 vaccines showed 70-95% efficacy and minimal risks. the aim of this study was to compare persons willing and unwilling to be vaccinated against covid-19 and to estimate the effects of vaccination attributes on uptake: proof of vaccination, vaccination setting, effectiveness, duration of immunity, and risk of severe side effects. 
 Diabetes causes blood sugar spikes. So does eating sugar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blood sugar spikes cause arterial inflammation, which increases risk for both heart disease and covid complications.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]People who ate more sugar, died sooner.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All true facts. Rationalize them as you will. [SEP] the correlation of heart rate change with reported intoxication was +0.44 in women, when it was negative in men (newlin db: alcohol clin exp res 9:411-416, 1985). data revealed main effects for familial risk for both hangover questionnaires. soas reported significantly greater hangover symptoms than did sonas. individuals at elevated familial risk for alcoholism reportedly experienced more acute withdrawal and hangover, which might contribute to the development of problem drinking. paper presented to the research society on alcoholism, hilton head, sc, 1998] evolutionary game theory of addictive behavior specifies how evolutionarily stable strategies for survival and reproduction may lead to addiction. individuals who drink heavily are at an increased risk for adverse consequences of drinking and progression of their drinking habits to abuse or dependence. therefore, it is important to delineate factors associated with their heavy drinking. these data indicate that habitual moderate/heavy ethanol use was associated with greater stimulant-like effects after an acute dose of alcohol. this finding is consistent with the idea (newlin and thomson, 1990, 1999) that individuals who experience greater stimulant-like effects during the ascending limb and lesser sedative-like effects on the descending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve may be at greater risk for developing ethanol use disorders. although we cannot determine the causality of this association, sensitivity to the stimulant effects of ethanol may play an important role in the continuation of heavy ethanol use and the increased risk of negative consequences from this use. 
The predominant symptoms of ‘long COVID’ are psychological in nature, with anxiety and depression being most common. But those of course are also exactly the conditions which have been caused in, literally, millions of people, especially young people, by the lockdowns. [SEP] the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the covid-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. our study investigated the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of italian university students. covid-19 has caused significant distress around the globe. we examine the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and anxiety/depression during lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic in a longitudinal community sample. additionally, the likelihood of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown was elevated among women (or = 2.07 [95% ci = 1.32-3.25]), subjects with low household income (or = 2.28 [1.29-4.01]) and persons who reported being lonely (or = 3.94 [95% ci = 2.47-6.28]). our study underlines the role of preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression as a vulnerability factor of anxiety/depression during lockdown. the covid-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed by governments worldwide have had profound social and psychological effects, particularly for young adults. in response to the covid-19 disaster, people have developed several psychological problems mainly stress, anxiety, and depression. these psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with covid-19) and patients with covid-19 (who are waiting for death). since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, evidence shows the negative psychological impact of lockdown measures in the general population. 
       Not all brands of the vaccine can cause problems, there are brands that have higher lethal rates than others. The death rate of COVID is said to be 10%. It is probable that some vaccines (Maybe Johnson& Johnson) have a higher lethal rate than that [SEP] respondents were randomly assigned a vaccine brand (astrazeneca or johnson & johnson) and information about the vaccine's effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 infection (yes or no) and at preventing death from covid-19 (yes or no). the self-reported likelihood of taking an assigned astrazeneca or johnson & johnson vaccine was higher for respondents given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from covid-19 (b, 0.04; 95% ci, 0.01 to 0.06) and lower among those given information about its overall effectiveness at preventing symptomatic transmission (b, -0.03; 95% ci, -0.05 to 0.00), compared with those who were not given the information. the risk-benefit profile in children might not be equally favourable for all licensed paediatric influenza vaccines. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. the three covid 19 vaccines have a wide safety profile with only minor and self-limiting adverse effects. the most commonly used commercial vaccine (brand a) did not offer protection to challenged hamsters, whereas brand b facilitated the renal carrier state of the leptospira organism. there is no increased risk for mortality among covid-19 vaccine recipients. with the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, the importance of vaccines in epidemic prevention and public health has become even more obvious than ever. here, we review the characteristics of covid-19 vaccine candidates in five platforms and the latest clinical trial results of them. we also summarize the serious adverse events reported recently after the large-scale vaccination with the current covid-19 vaccines, including the thromboembolism caused by the astrazeneca and johnson & johnson vaccines. 
vaccines for COVID-19 are stopped as a matter of urgency in order to protect the public from serious harm and death.   It is also documented that Polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues relating to fertility.  9 [SEP] there are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in covid-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (peg) and polysorbate 80. contraindications to the administration of covid-19 vaccines include a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the first dose of covid-19 vaccine or proven hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, such as peg or polysorbate 80. polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 mrna vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as tween 80, in astrazeneca and johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. the production of the covid-19 vaccine at an unprecedented speed evoked the fear of skipping steps that would compromise vaccine safety. there were also persistent concerns with regard to vaccine compositions that could be harmful or contain aborted foetal cells. the excipient of potential concern in the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine is polysorbate 80 (ps80). patients allergic to peg, previously denied covid vaccination, may now be safely vaccinated with the ps80 containing astrazeneca vaccine and need only avoid the peg-containing mrna covid-19 vaccines. although covid-19 vaccines are becoming increasingly available, their ability to effectively control and contain the spread of the covid-19 pandemic is highly contingent on an array of factors. this paper discusses how limitations to vaccine accessibility, issues associated with vaccine side effects, concerns regarding vaccine efficacy, along with the persistent prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among the public, including health care professionals, might impact the potential of covid-19 vaccines to curb the pandemic. the urgency for covid-19 vaccines determined a dilution of the general expectations of safety and efficacy of vaccination (from safe and effective to safe and effective enough). 
Great Article about blot clots and vaccines! Thanks for sharing!  “... and “COVID-19 is far more likely to cause blood clots than a COVID-19 vaccine” are phrases that have been repeated like mantras. That needs to continue.” https://t.co/nnUwVtZpfW [SEP] the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). the blood of the covid-19 patients were found to clotted than the patients were prescribed the anticoagulant injections are prescribed. in this review, we provide a status update on covid-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials and discuss issues of concern beyond vaccine efficacy and safety, including dosing regimens, the mixed vaccine strategy, prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, antibody levels, cellular immunity and protection, variants of concern, covid-19 vaccine distribution, vaccination willingness, herd immunity, immunity passports, and vaccine indications. while the knowledge and development of covid-19 vaccines is rapidly expanding, the benefits of covid-19 vaccines must outweigh the potential risks of adverse events. although concerns regarding unusual blood clots and low platelet counts have been raised, the benefits of covid-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks of adverse events.what is the impact?except for children, the covid-19 vaccine is recommended for all people, including those pregnant or immunocompromised. vaccination is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting a person against covid-19. however, covid-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. we used the model to compare estimated deaths from az vaccine-associated tts with i) covid-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from covid-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). probability of dying from covid-related atypical severe blood clots was 58-126 times higher (depending on age and sex) than dying from tts. 
Even the New York Times is admitting:  “In rare cases, the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has led to severe and sometimes fatal blood clots. Newly published research from Germany and Norway describes a powerful immune reaction that may be the cause”. [SEP] from 11 march 2021, several european countries temporarily suspended the use of the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine amid reports of blood clot events and the death of a vaccinated person, despite the european medicines agency (ema) and the world health organization's assurance that there was no indication that vaccination was linked. this study aimed to identify and analyse the thrombotic adverse reactions associated with the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine. covid-19 causes several cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, myocarditis, pericarditis, and venous thromboembolism. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. within a short period, three scientific groups from norway, germany, and the uk reported cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia and anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies in individuals following astrazeneca-oxford vaccination and named this new syndrome vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt). here we present a case of severe immune thrombocytopenia after chadox1 covid-19 vaccination and its successful primary management. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). this patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive pe and deep venous thrombosis (dvt) due to sars-cov2 infection following the administration of the j&j vaccine. adverse emboli growths with increased d-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the astrazeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt). 
  Take a look at the Epstein-Barr virus - one of the primary causes of 'glandular fever'.  We know there's a link between it and cancers, neurological disease.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Covid-19 seems similar but more serious in that it's highly infectious and can kill people w/o causing chronic disease. [SEP] the presentation of hodgkin's disease and acute infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) due to epstein-barr virus, have similar seasonal features with the peak incidence around march. firstly glandular fever may accelerate presentation in young adults, destined to present with hd. this and other research reporting associations of mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and its complications. the nature of transmission of the virus makes it one of the most infectious pathogenic diseases that has ever existed. commonly, human coronaviruses cause illnesses such as intestinal and respiratory tract illnesses. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. it has generally been reported that patients with covid-19 show a fever, cough, and/or respiratory failure as the most common clinical symptoms but some have unusual symptoms, such as anosmia, diarrhea, and throat pain. consequently, this case suggests that even if patients show clinical symptoms and signs of common diseases for otolaryngologists, such as im, we should keep in mind the possibility of covid-19 without arbitrarily assuming that im is caused by epstein-barr virus. although almost always a benign, self-limiting disease, infectious mononucleosis accounts for considerable symptomatic illness in the young athlete and can, on occasion, be truly life-threatening. this acute infection by the epstein-barr virus is unique pathophysiologically--an acute, self-limiting, lymphoproliferative disorder with autoimmune features--and may well be the cause or one of the causes of several malignant neoplasms, burkitt's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Similar to medications and other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. Vaccine reactions are rare. Info about side effects: https://t.co/0zWPiWE9RX  VIDEO: https://t.co/kgwjzNMEnu [SEP] rare cases of severe allergic reactions after covid-19 vaccination have been observed, seemingly at a higher frequency than for other vaccines. however, besides the common and usually mild side effects of the authorized vaccines, some rare, major adverse reactions are increasingly being reported worldwide during the post marketing surveillance phase of vaccines' circulation, such as anaphylaxis, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, myopericarditis and guillain-barré syndrome. acceptance and side effects were analyzed for covid-19 vaccination. besides reports of alarming potential side effects after covid-19 vaccinations there have been rare observations of rather benign reactions to foreign materials such as cosmetic hyaluronic acid filler injections after a covid-19 immunization. side effects of vaccines are common, but people react differently to different vaccines. side effects as a result of vaccination are not rare and are proof that the immune system is responding. however, severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be dangerous, and they engender fear. as with any vaccination programme, reports of side effects have begun to emerge in the wake of vaccinations. however, as a significant number of the population began to receive various covid-19 vaccines, reports of various other moderate to severe side effects have now started to emerge. in this case series, we discuss the incidence of widespread rashes that develop in some individuals after receiving covid-19 vaccines by both astrazeneca (astrazeneca plc, cambridge, uk) and pfizer-biontech (pfizer inc., brooklyn, ny; biontech se, mainz, germany). 
   A statement that flies in the face of “Pick up your Pence” as head of the Covid Task Force. Pence is anti-science, said tobacco doesn’t cause cancer, increased HIV transmission as Governor, and Trump believes windmills cause cancer. Perdue downplayed Covid ! Vote him out! [SEP] the indiana state government under former governor and current us vice president mike pence fueled the hiv outbreak by prohibiting needle/syringe exchange and failed to take substantive action once the outbreak was identified. in march 2020, before covid-19 laid claim to the united states, vice president mike pence briefed the press about the coronavirus outbreak, which at the time was a threat to passengers aboard the grand princess cruise ship moored off the coast of california [1]. the decision by the trump administration to leave many of the policy decisions regarding covid-19 to united states governors has had significant consequences for the management of the pandemic. the risks from potential exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-covid-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. the risks from potential exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-covid-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. we examined whether feeling neutral about covid-19 was associated with attitudes about the top 2 presidential candidates (trump vs. biden) and behavior (i.e., whether a person voted and who they voted for). because feeling neutral about covid-19 might indicate that a person views the issue as unworthy of attention, a perspective more aligned with trump's approach, we hypothesized that feeling neutral about covid-19 would be associated with more pro-trump attitudes and behaviors. even after accounting for other affects about covid-19, in both studies, neutrality was associated with more favorable attitudes toward trump, less favorable attitudes toward biden, being less likely to vote, and if a person did vote, being more likely to vote for trump. the risks from potential exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-covid-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. this article investigates the impact of public reactions to the covid-19 panemic on voting for former president donald trump in the 2020 american presidential election. 
   Might sound counter intuitive, but even the common cold (which are caused by corona viruses) may help our immune system recognise Covid and respond to it better.  Maybe the same happens with the flu. [SEP] in terms of the biomedical paradigm the common cold is caused by numerous respiratory viruses, whilst flu is caused by the influenza virus. symptoms of flu include sudden onset of fever and cough, and colds are characterized by sneezing, sore throat, and runny nose, but in practice the symptoms often overlap. and as far as causation is concerned it is clear that lay people emphasize the role of 'resistance' and 'immunity' at least as much as 'infection' in accounting for the onset of colds and flu. maintaining influenza vaccination at high coverage has the potential to prevent a proportion of covid-19 morbidity and mortality. we examined whether flu-vaccination is associated with severe corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) disease, as measured by intensive care unit (icu)-admission, ventilator-use, and mortality. our findings showed that flu-vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of an icu admission especially among aged <65 and non-obese patients. public health promotion of flu-vaccination may help mitigate the overwhelming demand for critical covid-19 care pending the large-scale availability of covid-19 vaccines. in humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the human body is equipped with the immune system that can recognize, respond and fight against pathogens such as viruses. in fact, mscs transplantation can improve the overall outcome of covid-19 patients via multiple mechanisms; first through their immunomodulatory effects which will help to regulate the infected patient inflammatory response, second via promoting tissue-repair and regeneration, and third through their antifibrotic effects. 
Study: Pfizer's RNA-based covid vaccine could cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases, so its approval was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit. https://t.co/CyX9P1k9J5 https://t.co/vSTarg3dIG [SEP] one of the vaccines approved against covid-19 is the bnt162b2 mrna covid-19 vaccine (pfizer/biontech). in our opinion, the benefits of covid-19 vaccination largely outweigh its risks. with the recent approval and widespread administration of the pfizer-biontech, moderna, and janssen vaccines worldwide, incidence of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection has significantly decreased. in spite of their undisputed role in reducing the severity of the disease and reduction of the disease burden in the community, there have been case reports of serious side effects with these vaccines. pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine followed by moderna covid-19 mrna-1273 vaccine were the first to receive fda approval. here, we present the cases of three patients who developed lymphadenopathy after the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. after a year of advances in vaccine research and development, three vaccines for the prevention of covid-19 (manufactured by pfizer, moderna and johnson & johnson's janssen biotech) are approved for use in the usa. a longitudinal risk profile of neurologic complications caused from covid-19 vaccines remains limited, and prompt recognition of potential neurological complications from the covid-19 vaccine is of interest to public health. 
Expert Cardiologist ( Dr. Richard Flem­ing, physi­cist-nuclear car­di­ol­o­gist) recently issued a dire warn­ing !  Covid Vaccines Could Cause Mad Cow Disease ! ,  “I’m not anti-vax, “I’m just anti-bad medicine Flemming said”  My God ! More mad cows ! 😱🐮 https://t.co/r63fYNfii2 [SEP] but between 1994 and 1996, 12 people in england came down with cjd, the human form of mad cow, and all had eaten beef from suspect cows. and harley's study showed pathology identical to "mad cow" from systemic m. bovis in cattle, causing a tuberculous spongiform encephalitis. the possibility of the age-related reemergence of foodborne mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis) as a vector for creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd or human mad cow disease) and mad cow disease itself is real. all of this brings up the unthinkable: that alzheimer's, cruetzfeldt-jackob, and mad cow disease might just be caused by eating the meat or dairy in consumer products or feed. experts on brain-riddling spongiform diseases have grown steadily more uneasy over signs that so-called mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), which is linked to a lethal human illness, may be lurking in sheep. although there is no proven link between a newly recognized variant form of cjd and "mad cow disease," and no evidence that cjd can be spread through the blood supply, the theoretical risk has scientists scrambling to understand how the disease is spread and policymakers struggling with the thorny issue of whether to notify persons who have received blood or blood products that may place them at risk. mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) is a fatal neurological disease of cattle first recognized in the united kingdom (uk) in 1986. as a result of new developments, alarmist media attention, bureaucratic mishandling of the issues, scientific uncertainty, bickering among technical experts, and a dearth of easily assimilated and balanced information on the problem, widespread fears that affected cattle could enter the human food supply and transmit the disease to humans have periodically erupted, causing social, economic, and political consequences of tremendous magnitude. since reports of the "mad cow disease" epidemic in great britain erupted in the international press, sensational and intimidating articles about the risk that bovine spongiform encephalopathy and related diseases may pose to humans have appeared. alarm bells rang eight years ago with the evidence that mad cow disease could pass from cows to humans via the food chain. 
    It doesn't matter that only 14k people died of covid alone. This is completely fucking irrelevant, especially considering the fact that Covid literally causes things like pneumonia, which are included in that CDC page. [SEP] fighting covid-19 achieved collateral benefits on significant reductions of severe influenza burden, invasive s. pneumoniae disease activity, and the death toll from pneumonia reported to cdc in taiwan. fighting covid-19 achieved collateral benefits on significant reductions of severe influenza burden, invasive s. pneumoniae disease activity, and the death toll from pneumonia reported to cdc in taiwan. the aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of post-mortem whole ct-scanning in identifying covid-19 pneumonia as a cause of death, by comparing chest ct-findings of confirmed covid-19 fatalities to control cases. so far, covid-19 pandemic has affected the way people live and work globally, and has resulted in extreme strain on the healthcare systems worldwide. since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) in december 2019, more than 23 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with sars-cov-2. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to covid-19 on death certificates reported to cdc (1). concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to covid-19 (2). these findings support the accuracy of covid-19 mortality surveillance in the united states using official death certificates. accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, and of covid-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action. 
Stay #InTheKnow about the COVIID-19 vaccine: 1 - The Pfizer & Moderna vaccines require two doses, 3–4 weeks apart;  2 - The vaccines can’t cause COVID-19;  3 - Vaccines provide protection, but won’t prevent infection. #JTCHS #WeKnow https://t.co/OQUnaWSE58 [SEP] the mrna covid-19 vaccines (moderna and pfizer-biontech) provide strong protection against severe covid-19, including hospitalization, for at least several months after receipt of the second dose (1,2). to understand how vaccine effectiveness (ve) might change with time, cdc and collaborators assessed the comparative effectiveness of moderna and pfizer-biontech vaccines in preventing covid-19-associated hospitalization at two periods (14-119 days and ≥120 days) after receipt of the second vaccine dose among 1,896 u.s. veterans at five veterans affairs medical centers (vamcs) during february 1-september 30, 2021. adjusted ve 14-119 days following second moderna vaccine dose was 89.6% (95% ci = 80.1%-94.5%) and after the second pfizer-biontech dose was 86.0% (95% ci = 77.6%-91.3%); at ≥120 days ve was 86.1% (95% ci = 77.7%-91.3%) for moderna and 75.1% (95% ci = 64.6%-82.4%) for pfizer-biontech. vaccination with the moderna covid-19 vaccine consists of 2 doses (100 μg, 0.5 ml each) administered intramuscularly, 1 month (4 weeks) apart. two of the covid-19 vaccines currently approved in the united states require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of covid-19 from november 2020 to january 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious sars-cov-2 variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. pfizer-biontech vaccines also averted an additional 0.61 (95% cri: 0.37 - 0.89) hospitalizations and 0.31 (95% cri: 0.23 - 0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. both pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mrna-based covid-19 vaccines, whereas the janssen covid-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. as of november 2, 2021, approximately 248 million doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine had been administered to persons aged ≥12 years in the united states. * on october 29, 2021, fda issued an eua amendment for a new formulation of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine for use in children aged 5-11 years, administered as 2 doses (10 μg, 0.2 ml each), 3 weeks apart (table) (1). 
  It's the norm for a death certificate to list >1 cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most common 'other causes' are conditions that can be CAUSED by severe Covid - e.g. pneumonia or respiratory failure, and chronic conditions such as diabetes that people can live with for years, until catching Covid. [SEP] the aim of the present study was to examine death certificates of persons who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) to (a) quantify the number of deaths directly caused by coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); (b) estimate the most common complications leading to death; and (c) identify the most common comorbidities. overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18-84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. both the underlying cause of death (ucod), and all diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death) were investigated; a further analysis was carried out through a simulation where the ucod was selected after substituting icd-10 codes for covid with unspecified pneumonia. based on the ucod, the increases in mortality were observed for covid and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. we report findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe covid-19. our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to covid-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. we therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of covid-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death. 15,036 mortality records from kentucky death certificates were examined for year 2000 for all deaths due to diseases most often associated with copd; notably, heart disease, pneumonia/influenza, and asthma. all causes, as listed on the death certificate, whether underlying or contributing, were considered "any mention" causes. 
 I really can’t believe that a steroid based treatment wasn’t already used widely in Covid19 https://t.co/FYuDGMTxwJ late dad had COPD and he was on them practically 365 days for decades ! I know covid & copd arent the same but both cause breathlessness amongst other things. [SEP] expert commentary: cardiovascular morbidity and mortality amongst patients with copd is substantial. enabling people to achieve 'controlled co-existence' with copd challenges health professionals to educate people with copd on how to effectively manage their disease. one hundred and sixty-three (61% response) patients were interviewed, mean age 72 years, 50% female, with diagnosis of copd and at least two of: forced expiratory volume in the first second (fev(1)) <40% predicted, hospital admissions or acute severe exacerbations with copd, long-term oxygen therapy, cor pulmonale, use of oral steroids, and being housebound. to assess the influence of inhaled corticosteroids (icss) on mortality in copd patients, which is currently a controversial topic. we examined mortality in people 90 to 365 days after hospital discharge for copd, comparing those persons who received inhaled steroids within 90 days of hospital discharge with those who did not. we also compared mortality in patients who received inhaled steroids with those who received other respiratory drugs, but not inhaled steroids, and those who received neither. using nested case control analysis, we examined the time of receipt of inhaled steroids in relation to fatal events. in people > 65 years of age, inhaled steroids were associated with a 25% reduction in mortality between 90 and 365 days after hospital discharge, while mortality increased with bronchodilator use, physician visits, age, and comorbidities. inhaled steroids were associated with an even larger mortality reduction in people aged 35 to 64 years. people who received bronchodilators but no steroids had higher mortality than people who received no bronchodilators or received both bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. 
Wearing a mask does cause disease, harm the immune system or create any healthy problems   https://t.co/wMCxAkV27U [SEP] in this commentary, we discuss the physiological effects of wearing masks for prolonged periods of time, including special considerations, such as mask wearing among those who engage in exercise training, and concerns for individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases. in healthy populations, wearing a mask does not appear to cause any harmful physiological alterations, and the potentially life-saving benefits of wearing face masks seem to outweigh the documented discomforts (e.g. while there are minimal physiological impacts on wearing a mask, theoretical evidence suggests that there may be consequential psychological impacts of mask wearing on the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. these psychological impacts may contribute to the controversy associated with wearing masks during the covid-19 pandemic in the united states. after we discuss the physiological impacts of mask wearing, we will discuss psychological effects associated with wearing masks during the covid-19 pandemic. face mask could be risk for the people of under lying medical conditions, old age group, outdoor exercise, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and feeble innate immune. our results suggest that wearing a surgical mask does not produce significant respiratory impairment in healthy subjects nor in subjects with asthma. a face mask is probably effective in preventing the spread of a respiratory pathogen, at least to some extent. the spread of covid-19 has made mask wear essential. wearing a mask for extended periods increases skin wrinkles and pores and using a moisturizer when wearing the mask helps to reduce this problem. 
Covid-19 can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus and dizziness https://t.co/V5itwb4NX4 [SEP] the results of the meta-analysis demonstrate that the er of hearing loss (3.1%, cis: 0.01-0.09), tinnitus (4.5%, cis: 0.012-0.153), and dizziness (12.2%, cis: 0.070-0.204) is statistically significant in patients with covid-19 (z ≤ -4.469, p ≤ 0.001). covid-19 can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness. self-reported changes in hearing, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and dizziness/rotatory vertigo were assessed in hospitalised and non-hospitalised covid-19 patients during and after the acute phase of the disease and compared to non-covid controls. tinnitus and equilibrium disorders such as dizziness and vertigo have been reported by patients with covid-19; however, they have been rarely investigated. this study suggests that the presence of subjective otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus and balance disorders can affect covid-19 patients; further studies are necessary to investigate the prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these subjective symptoms in covid-19 patients. a variety of neurosensory symptoms including tinnitus have been associated with covid-19 infection. while most cases of tinnitus are associated with hearing loss, here we report a case of severe tinnitus following covid-19 infection with normal thresholds through 8000 hz. a 49-year-old male presented with new onset severe tinnitus following covid-19 infection. this patient may represent a subpopulation of patients who suffer from severe tinnitus following covid-19 infection in the setting of largely normal hearing. however, this is the first reported case of hearing loss and tinnitus in a covid-19 patient, in the state of qatar, and this case report strives to contribute to the ocean of literature highlighting the need for otorhinolaryngologists to be aware of its correlation with covid-19 virus. 
#covid19 a risk for a severe case is highly linked to #obesity. And #diet #nutrition #processed foods is the main cause.  #shame does not work. Listen & learn https://t.co/HcVtMGzNBQ [SEP] while food insecurity is a well-known cause of under-nutrition and stunting, in recent decades it has also been linked with obesity. by comparing this evidence to existing theory on food security and nutrition, we aimed to provide a richer understanding of the nuances and the socio-demographic nature of the food insecurity-obesity relationship. affordability of high-energy, processed foods was identified as a main mechanism, which determined whether or not food insecurity leads to obesity in low- and middle-income countries. despite the limited empirical evidence available, our review presents meaningful and policy-relevant insights into the food insecurity-obesity relationship in from low- and middle-income countries. obesity has become a concern of epidemic proportion involving globally both children and adults. although genetically linked, lack of physical activity and the outstanding growing of the food market are the main behavioral causes of obesity. in fact, several studies linked cvd with unhealthy nutrition, alcohol consumption, stress, and smoking, together with a low level of physical activity. a global pandemic like covid19 poses some serious questions and challenges in the minds of practicing pediatricians as what support to offer our children, theirparents and carers-alleviating their anxiety about their child's diet and nutrition, that is critical at this time of crisis. although the evidence for pediatric nutrition and covid19 is not strong, this article aims to critically look into pediatric nutrition during covid19 pandemic and bring the most recent evidence into limelight and making the right choices with pediatric nutrition. this review points at the importance nutrition as a stimulant to covid19 in the pediatric population. 
   The coronavirus is related to HIV and HIV can cause seizures if there is infection in the central nervous system also sudden cardiac arrest can cause a short period of seizing. [SEP] new-onset seizures are frequent manifestations of central nervous system disorders in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). cerebral mass lesions, cryptococcal meningitis, and hiv-encephalopathy are common causes of seizures. the prognosis of seizure disorders in hiv-infected patients depends upon the underlying cause. epileptic seizures are a relatively common manifestation of central nervous system involvement in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), but, to our knowledge, isolated, chronic epc has not been previously reported. infection with hiv enhances the risk of seizures, but, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of "inflammatory" epc. other important hiv-induced neurological disorders include vacuolar myelopathy and an increased risk of seizures. seizures in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) patients can be caused by a wide variety of opportunistic infections, and, especially in developing countries, tuberculosis (tb) should be high on the differential. seizure occurs in 2 to 3% and 6.1% to 34.3% in patients with hiv infection and patients with neurological complications of hiv infection, respectively. the purpose of this study was to assess clinical presentation, cause and treatment outcome of patients with hiv infection presented with seizure. in this retrospective study, patients aged ≥ 13 years with hiv infection presented with seizure were included. 
  I just saw that FB won't allow anyone to see the vid I shared "Doctors Speak Out About This Powerful Covid Treatment".  "...information that could cause physical harm" Very annoying. Meanwhile I've begun IVM as prophylaxis. Feeling good about that.  Thank u Dr. Kory! [SEP] here we examine patients' views of the effect of the internet on their relationship with doctors. we ran 8 disease specific focus groups of between 2 and 8 respondents comprising adult patients with diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease or hepatitis c. data are presented on (i) the perceived benefits and (ii) limitations of the internet in the context of the doctor-patient relationship, (iii) views on sharing information with doctors, and (iv) the potential of the internet for the future. doctors therefore need not feel challenged or threatened when patients bring health information from the internet to a consultation, rather they should see it as an attempt on the part of the patient to work with the doctor and respond positively. increasingly, people are using facebook (fb) to share health information. patients with dm are increasingly sharing their health information with other fb users. this study will help inform future research with regard to health information sharing and designing appropriate interventions to harness the power of social media in improving public health. we systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (ivm) in covid-19 patients. in comparison to soc or placebo, ivm did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in rcts in covid-19 patients with mostly mild disease. ivm is not a viable option to treat covid-19 patients. provision of accurate, accessible information about the benefits and harms of antibiotics is key to an ethical approach to antimicrobial stewardship and to supporting shared decision making. 
Fauci's 2,000 emails a day show how little U.S. officials knew of Covid pandemic  We were played!!! This lock down, mask (oh leading cause of respiratory pneumonia), our freedom all put on hold the joke of the millennium!!!!!!! https://t.co/kiSZGQJiTx [SEP] covid-19 has changed our lives as we knew it. the world is not naive to infectious disease outbreaks, having experienced pandemics such as the h1n1 outbreak in 2009 with up to 400,000 deaths, and the "spanish flu" in 1919 with up to 50 million deaths worldwide respectively (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/pandemic-influenza/past-pandemics). this study aimed to assess the nurses' knowledge, concerns, perceived impact and preparedness toward the covid-19 pandemic. as covid-19 is a new disease, its spread and emergence cause fear, anxiety and confusion among the general population. since the outbreak of a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in wuhan, hubei province, china, in december 2019, the disease was later officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2), quickly spreading globally. the variety and extent of non-pharmaceutical measures implemented by the government to control covid-19 in argentina were exceptional, making this country the best example to analyze the evolution of covid-19 under the most stringent and longer-lasting restrictive policies- which included 119 days of strict nation-wide lock-down, 304 days of less restrictive lock-downs, and 35 days of curfews. the failure to detect any benefit on ameliorating covid-19 by the long and strict nation-wide lock-downs in argentina should raise world-wide concerns about mandating costly and ineffective restrictive measures during ongoing or future pandemics. little did the world know it was the prelude of what would be a devastating pandemic. the disease was officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and has been declared a pandemic disease by the world health organization (who). in december 2019 a novel coronavirus was firstly encountered in wuhan/china with a massive outbreak of fatal pneumonia leading to a pandemic declared by the world health organization in march 2020 (who dashboard covid-19. 
  It’s a politicised 99.98% survival rate virus. ‘Fully vaccinated’ in the states are testing positive for covid. It’s not a vaccine, it’s an experimental ( until 2025 ), mRNA gene therapy that causes autoimmune diseases and sterilisation to name a few. [SEP] previous infection with sars-cov-2 (the virus that causes covid-19) or covid-19 vaccination can provide immunity and protection from subsequent sars-cov-2 infection and illness. among covid-19-like illness hospitalizations in persons whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, the odds of laboratory-confirmed covid-19 (adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics) among unvaccinated, previously infected adults were higher than the odds among fully vaccinated recipients of an mrna covid-19 vaccine with no previous documented infection (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 5.49; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.75-10.99). our integrated analysis emphasizes that vaccines used in the united states are highly effective in decreasing severe covid-19, hospitalizations, and deaths. this case report exemplifies potential safety issues that may be encountered with new vaccine administration in patients with recent covid-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. the prioritization of u.s. health care personnel for early receipt of messenger rna (mrna) vaccines against severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), allowed for the evaluation of the effectiveness of these new vaccines in a real-world setting. messenger rna (mrna) vaccines have recently emerged as a new type of vaccine technology, showing strong potential to combat the covid-19 pandemic. this review summarises the current progresses of mrna vaccines designed for a range of diseases including covid-19. official names have been announced for the virus responsible, previously known as "2019 novel coronavirus" and the diseases it causes are, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and coronavirus disease (covid-19), respectively. currently, several therapeutic options for covid-19 are proposed and vaccine development has been initiated for prevention purposes. furthermore, in the next part of the current review, various vaccination approaches against covid-19 including whole virus vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccine, dna vaccines, and mrna vaccines are discussed. 
 Severity of DAD or more chronic lung damage, clinical history. If there’s no other obvious cause of death in somebody who was admitted for covid, it’s covid. If there was something else like an MI, it’s a question of how severe systemic disease 2/2 covid/long term intubation [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a respiratory and systemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection. diffuse alveolar damage (dad) is a ubiquitous finding in inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)-related deaths, but recent reports have also described additional atypical findings, including vascular changes. an aim of this study was to assess lung autopsy findings in covid-19 inpatients, and in untreated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)-positive individuals who died in the community, in order to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. dad is the primary histological manifestation of severe lung disease in covid-19 patients who die both in hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxaemic mechanical ventilation to the histological changes. we assess the utility of a centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) guidelines-based coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) screening checklist for postmortem severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) surveillance, detailing the relationship between the histologic findings at autopsy and attribution of death to covid-19.sars-cov-2 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at the time of autopsy in all "checklist-positive" decedents. we report a case of 40-year-old male admitted for covid-19 and rapidly deteriorated into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with no prior history of smoking or lung disease. we aimed to present autopsy-confirmed causes of death in patients who died with covid-19 and to assess the association between thrombosis and diffuse alveolar damage consistent with covid-19 (dad). covid-19 caused or contributed to death in 71% of clinical and 83% of forensic autopsies, in whom significant dad was observed. of the patients with covid-19 as the primary cause of death, only 19% had no thrombotic phenomena in the lungs, as opposed to 38% amongst those with covid-19 as a contributing cause of death and 54% amongst patients whose death was not related to covid-19 (p = 0.002). dad leads to ards in covid-19 patients. 
 The Covid patient “long haulers” are also very similar to some of us cancer patients. The aftermath of the disease (and for some of us C pts caused by treatment) is very similar. The brain fog, chronic fatigue, pain etc. [SEP] there are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the "brain fog" described in long covid. this review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long covid. we sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non-hospitalized covid-19 "long haulers". non-hospitalized covid-19 "long haulers" experience prominent and persistent "brain fog" and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life. these patients are considered to suffer from what has been termed as "chronic" or "long" covid-19 or a form of post-acute sequelae of covid-19, and patients experiencing this syndrome have been termed covid-19 long-haulers. covid-19 leads to severe respiratory problems, but also to long-covid syndrome associated primarily with cognitive dysfunction and fatigue. long-covid syndrome symptoms, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients undertaking or following chemotherapy for cancer (chemofog or chemobrain), as well in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs) or mast cell activation syndrome (mcas). patients with long-term symptoms following covid-19 are being called long haulers. specifically, the presence of persistent symptoms after apparent resolution from covid-19 have frequently been reported throughout the pandemic by individuals labeled as "long-haulers". our objective was to determine which symptoms among long-hauler covid-19 patients change over time, and how their symptoms compare to another chronic illness group. 
https://t.co/MUVrI0jkpX Scientists haven’t figured out  #LongCovid. Here are 5 of their best hypotheses. From disturbing the gut microbiome to lingering in the brain, there are many ways the coronavirus might cause lasting symptoms. #ApresJ20 #CovidLong [SEP] the gut microbiome is hypothesized to be linked with many neurological disorders; however, little conclusive evidence is available in this area. given the potency of antimicrobials utilized to treat septic patients, the effects on the gut microbiome are often rapid and long-lasting, in which case full recovery may never be observed. the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has gained increased attention in the neuroscience community, especially taking into account the neuroinvasive potential of its causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), and the impact of its infection on the structure and function of the brain. apart from the neurotropic properties of sars-cov-2, it is likewise important the observation that virus infection may perturb specific cellular processes that are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disorders, particularly in parkinson's disease (pd). in this scenario, viral infection-induced colon inflammation, gut microbial imbalance, and α-synuclein upregulation are of particular interest with regard to the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (microbiome-gut-brain axis). in this perspective, we present a critical view on the different hypotheses that are recently being raised by neuroscientists about the relationship between sars-cov-2 infection and long-lasting neurodegenerative disorders, opening the question of whether covid-19 might represent a risk factor for the development of pd. if similar processes are present in humans, the effects of enteric virus infections might have longer-term impacts extending beyond the directly observed symptoms. dysfunction of the gut microbiome can be caused by short-term (virus infection and other infectious diseases) or long-term (environment, nutrition, and stress) factors. here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (covid-19). the coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the raas. 
 and please don't go into the hands of corona virus... it's not safe, it's injurious to your health and it's causes corona virus. [SEP] corona virus is a respiratory virus which causes infectious covid-19 (corona virus -2019) disease and globally the virus continues to pose major risks of mortality. vaccines are available to prevent corona virus contagious infection or to reduce the viral load in body but virus is continuously mutating itself to infect people at severity. the corona virus disease of 2019 pandemic caused by the sars-cov-2 virus continues to inflict significant morbidity and mortality around the globe. -corona virus is a virus capable of mutating very quickly and many other viruses that arise due to mutations of this virus. corona virus (covid-19) is an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel corona virus and declared to be a global health emergency and a pandemic by the world health organization (who) on march 11, 2020. conclusions: this study showed satisfactory knowledge, attitude, and practice towards corona virus disease-2019 in saudi arabia. the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (also known as 2019-ncov) is a highly infectious agent and is declared as a global public health emergency by the world health organisation. the world is reeling under the crisis caused by corona virus disease (covid-19), print, electronic and social media are flooded with numerous advisories issued by governments and other national & international agencies. a corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a contagious disease which is caused by a novel corona virus. the whole article highlights the general characteristics of corona virus, their molecular diversity, and molecular protein targeting against covid-19 with their newer approaches. 
 You have a better chance of being hit with lightning then to get a blood clot from a vaccine. Actually Covid can cause a blood clot. [SEP] we evaluate the effect of the addition of pathogenic hit-like antibodies to blood on the resulting microstructure of the formed clot. very recent findings reveal that 20-30% of patients at high risk of mortality from covid-19 infection experience blood clotting that leads to stroke and sudden death. the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). in conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by cha vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic saes. this viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. this case study demonstrates the significance of covid-19 diagnostic testing due to the possibility of developing blood clots and potential complications, including hit. blood in any syringe or catheter, therefore, will clot more slowly in the presence of nonionic or ionic cm, the inhibitory effects of the latter being more profound. blood clots, seizures, and tinnitus were very rare but were more common in the people who got the vaccine than in those who got the placebo. the blood of the covid-19 patients were found to clotted than the patients were prescribed the anticoagulant injections are prescribed. 
  No people are developing these diseases and dieing as a result of becoming infected with Covid 19 for example people with diabetes getting Covid and dieing of renal failure or young people getting Covid and having a stroke as it causes blood clots eg. https://t.co/AMn7OnXr15 [SEP] covid-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus named as sars-cov-2. coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease) more likely to develop severe covid-19 and to die than those without underlying conditions? on the other hand, young people without any secondary disease have died by covid-19 as well. the infection causes coronavirus disease (covid-19) in people of all age groups, notably diabetic and old age people, at a higher risk of infectivity and fatality. the covid-19 infection causes metabolism complications, which may induce diabetes and accelerate aging in healthy individuals. our research indicates that the risk of getting covid-19 disease is not equal. however, it is not well-known whether children and young adults with type 2 diabetes are at risk of getting a severe infection of covid-19. results: having reviewed the currently limited evidence, it has been found that the incidence of covid-19 among children with type 2 diabetes seems to be not much different from children without diabetes. conclusion: children and young adults with type 2 diabetes are not at risk of severe covid-19 infection as the case in adults with diabetes. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has frightened the sports and physical activity community and enthusiasts for potential transmission, dissemination, and lethality in vulnerable populations; those with chronic diseases, co-morbidities, the elderly people, and in young and healthy people. 
    Mask wearing as recommended by the CDC does not cause hypoxia. COVID has been clearly associated with higher risk of stroke, though no question a sedentary lifestyle as well. [SEP] in this commentary, we discuss the physiological effects of wearing masks for prolonged periods of time, including special considerations, such as mask wearing among those who engage in exercise training, and concerns for individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases. in healthy populations, wearing a mask does not appear to cause any harmful physiological alterations, and the potentially life-saving benefits of wearing face masks seem to outweigh the documented discomforts (e.g. these psychological impacts may contribute to the controversy associated with wearing masks during the covid-19 pandemic in the united states. although masks are recommended for those with asthma in the era of covid-19, there is limited research exploring the extent of and problems related to mask use in adults with asthma. fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing a mask in public indoor settings, regardless of transmission level, if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or is at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated (including children aged <12 years who are currently ineligible for vaccination). exercising with facemasks may reduce available oxygen and increase air trapping preventing substantial carbon dioxide exchange. wearing masks against 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others. so, should we recommend wearing a face mask to all during a pandemic of respiratory infectious disease (eg, covid-19) without any precautions or exemptions? to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the centers for disease control and prevention issued recommendations that individuals wear face masks in public. among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected covid-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse j-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected covid-19 infection. 
 Covid is no joke, this is why we need the vaccine. We know that mRNA doesn't cause long term effects since it decomposes in your body within 1-2 hours. Please everyone, get vaccinated as soon as you can! [SEP] the coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) first appeared in wuhan, china in late 2019 and since then has caused unprecedented economic and social disruption as well as presenting a major challenge to public health. sars cov-2 and its associated disease covid-19 has devastated the world during 2020. since introducing the sars-cov-2 vaccination, different adverse effects and complications have been linked to the vaccine. variable neurological complications have been reported after receiving the covid-19 vaccine, such as acute encephalopathy. since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in december 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the number of confirmed infections has risen to more than 242 million worldwide, with nearly 5 million deaths. however, vaccine efficacy (ve) can be jeopardised by the rapid emergence and spread of sars-cov-2 variants of concern (vocs) that could escape from neutralising antibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity. objectives: more than 1 year after the start of the covid-19 pandemic it is becoming increasingly clear that vaccines will prove to be essential in combating this global pandemic. while vaccines ensure individual protection against covid-19 infection, delay in receipt or refusal of vaccines will have both individual and community impacts. following rapid distribution and administration of the mrna covid-19 vaccines (pfizer-biontech and moderna) under an emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration (2), observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness (ve) ranging from 53% to 92% against sars-cov-2 infection (3-6). these findings indicate that mrna vaccines provide protection against sars-cov-2 infection among nursing home residents; however, ve was lower after the delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the united states. 
NATE BURRUANO 🇺🇸 It’s nbd that the Moderna covid vaccine includes ingredients NOT FOR HUMAN USE, which are known to cause cancer, fertility/fetal viability issues, and damage the nervous system along with your kidneys. https://t.co/jfnWR0Y2cP [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infections can cause many complications, including central nervous system (cns) complications. the moderna covid-19 vaccine is a recently approved mrna-based vaccine aimed at preventing covid-19 infections and their complications. here, we describe two patients with no known neurological or psychiatric history who presented with encephalopathy and seizures that began after part one of their moderna covid-19 vaccine series. on december 18, 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for the moderna covid-19 (mrna-1273) vaccine (modernatx, inc; cambridge, massachusetts), a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mrna vaccine encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) (1). recently, the food and drug administration (fda) has approved the emergency use of pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccine on december 12, 2020. however, there are concern about the new covid-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. in addition, both coronavirus and covid-19 vaccine are new at this point and there is no scientific evidence to know whether people who are vaccinated can still carry the covid 19 pathogens and pass them along to others. both pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines are mrna vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. sars-cov-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. the covid-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. 
 6 women out of +6M given. We won't know for a long time their medical history. The problem is that the disease for the vaccine can cause blood clots. So the immune reaction, in extremely rare cases, is blood clots. I still think the vaccine is better than COVID. [SEP] however, covid-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. herein we present current considerations regarding the covid-19 vaccines including: efficacy against new variants, challenges in distribution, disparities in availability, dosage gender and race difference, covid-19 vaccine transport and storage, limitations in children and pregnant women. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. numerous covid-19 vaccines have been shown to have great efficacy levels through clinical trials. introduction: concerns about the increased risk of blood clots associated with the vaxzevria (previously named oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine) and johnson & johnson (janssen) covid-19 vaccines raises the question of the thrombotic safety of other covid-19 vaccines such as pfizer-biontech or moderna, especially in younger women, who at the early stage of the pandemic was a priority group for vaccination. methods: using the us-based vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) and the fda event reporting system (faers), we retrieved cases of thrombosis following vaccinations or hormonal contraceptive use in women aged ≤ 50 years. results: on 19 march 2021, out of 13.6 million women aged ≤ 50 exposed to at least one dose of pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines in the us, only 61 cases were reported with a total of 68 thromboembolic events (1 case per 222,951 vaccinated). conclusion: our results do support that, when compared to hormonal contraceptive use, the mrna vaccines do not show disproportional reporting of thromboembolic events in younger women. we used the model to compare estimated deaths from az vaccine-associated tts with i) covid-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from covid-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). 
 As you can still get covid when vaccinated, it is uncertain whether the vaccine will protect against long covid. Only time will tell on this one. Even a mild case of infection can cause long covid. [SEP] despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against covid-19 infection. finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that covid-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. the present study confirmed that the authorized covid-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. all covid-19 vaccines are effective and do not appear to carry any additional risk for patients with ms. the risks of covid-19 disease outweigh any potential risks from the vaccine. safe and effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) provide the best opportunity to control the pandemic. the wait and learn group, compared to the intenders, were less likely to report being diagnosed with a high risk condition for covid-19, receiving an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, discussing covid-19 vaccine with their healthcare provider, perceiving covid-19 as severe, considering a covid-19 vaccine important to stop the spread of infection, and wering a mask usually or almost always. although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against covid-19 in this current pandemic situation. compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. although these vaccines are highly effective in preventing covid-19 for a short period, safety and efficiency evaluations should be continuously monitored over a long time period. 
   This whole vaccine thing is nuts. This vaccine has the potential to cause huge issues whereas catching it and recovery is less of a health risk. Plus the medications that work well to fight covid but no..let’s push this vaccine mandate. Good luck to those that get it. [SEP] background: vaccination is considered to be a key public health intervention to end the covid-19 pandemic. results: although there is broad public support for making the vaccine available free of charge, vaccine hesitancy and the opposition to a vaccine mandate are widespread. conclusion: we propose that overcoming the inherent free-rider problem of achieving sufficiently high vaccination rates poses a potential dilemma for policymakers: given the politicized nature of the issue, they may find themselves having to choose between making vaccinations compulsory at political costs and a lingering pandemic at high costs for public health and the economy. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccination is essential to fight the pandemic. the rollout of vaccines against covid-19 is prompting governments and the private sector to adopt mandates. vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle to covid-19 vaccination. under these circumstances, vaccination is the only effective solution that can save millions of lives across the globe. in order to limit the disease burden and economic costs associated with the covid-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how effective and widely distributed a vaccine must be in order to have a beneficial impact on public health. to evaluate the potential effect of a vaccine, we developed risk equations for the daily risk of covid-19 infection both currently and after a vaccine becomes available. however, if less than 40% of people get vaccinated and other protection options are abandoned-as may well happen in the wake of a covid-19 vaccine-then introducing even an excellent vaccine will produce a worse outcome than our current situation. 
The fact that we haven't found myocarditis with CMR in the hearts of asymptomatic, otherwise healthy athletes Doesn't mean that a *symptomatic* Long Covid patient cannot have myopericarditis  As seen w/ vaccine side effects in the young, just the S-protein by itself can cause it [SEP] since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) pandemic, several cases of myocarditis related to covid-19 infection have been reported. this case highlights the need for studying the long-term cardiovascular complications of covid-19 and reinforces the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) and cardiac biomarkers in the diagnosis of covid-19-related myocarditis. covid-19-associated myocarditis has been well-described, but the prevalence of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in young athletes after covid-19 infection is unknown. conclusions our study suggests that the prevalence of myocardial inflammation or fibrosis after an asymptomatic or mild course of ambulatory covid-19 among competitive athletes is modest (9%), but would be missed by ecg, ti, and strain echocardiography. we report a case series of 5 young male patients with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr)-confirmed acute myocarditis within 72 h after receiving a dose of an mrna-based covid-19 vaccine. in conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and covid-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying cmr abnormalities. this case report describes a high school athlete with palpitation, myalgia, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion after sars-cov-2 infection with evidence of myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr), but echocardiography and troponin were normal. because acute myocarditis is a risk factor for sudden death in competitive athletes, pediatric cardiologists should consider performing additional tests such as cardiac mri in symptomatic covid-19 patients, even if cardiac biomarkers and echocardiograms are normal. to investigate the cardiovascular consequences of sars-cov-2 infection in highly trained, otherwise healthy athletes using cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging and to compare our results with sex-matched and age-matched athletes and less active controls. among 147 highly trained athletes after sars-cov-2 infection, cardiac involvement on cmr showed a modest frequency (4.7%), with definite signs of myocarditis present in only 1.4%. 
  the government of #Canada was negligent and caused unprecedented damage and death. Could have been prevented!!! There must be an accounting. #COVID  https://t.co/fMzDmaGdO6 [SEP] health policy pundits often observe that covid-19 exposes healthcare's grave deficiencies, inequities and underdeveloped capacities - factors hobbling canada's covid-19 pandemic response. it also features accounts of how healthcare leaders, providers and stakeholders did what was possible - not perfect - to contain covid-19's consequences. to date, there have been more than 2.3 million confirmed cases and more than 160,000 deaths globally caused by covid-19. in the ongoing pandemic, death statistics influence people's feelings and government policy. the uk government's reckless and incompetent response to covid-19 has produced an outcome which is amongst the worst in the world, and arguably the worst in terms of deaths per 100,000 population of major countries (especially when one measures mortality from covid in terms of cause of death on the death certificate, rather than the uk government's own measure-death of a tested individual within 28 days of testing). this article updates my initial analysis in this journal over a year ago, and traces the negligent and shambolic policy-making, and supine official scientific advice, which has led to such a dismal outcome. it dressed up its incompetence as a superficial libertarianism and defence of the economy, but thereby managed to achieve the worst of all worlds in terms of three egregious failures-appalling health outcomes; (ironically) worse economic damage than countries which took draconian action; and (also ironically) continually recurring restrictions as a result of earlier failure to take strong action to suppress covid and keep it at bay. cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in canada, accounting for some 30 000 deaths annually. background and aims: the covid-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented public health crisis globally irrespective of age. the immunopathology of covid-19 appears to be clearly associated with a dysregulated immune response leading to organ failure and death. 
  They have known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem.   Why haven’t they paused those, too? https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. this article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines. both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the pfizer/biontech vaccine compared to the moderna covid-19 vaccine; however, the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. ve against covid-19 hospitalizations was higher for the moderna vaccine (93%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 91%-95%) than for the pfizer-biontech vaccine (88%; 95% ci = 85%-91%) (p = 0.011); ve for both mrna vaccines was higher than that for the janssen vaccine (71%; 95% ci = 56%-81%) (all p<0.001). moderna and pfizer covid-19 vaccines are widely available options. to understand how vaccine effectiveness (ve) might change with time, cdc and collaborators assessed the comparative effectiveness of moderna and pfizer-biontech vaccines in preventing covid-19-associated hospitalization at two periods (14-119 days and ≥120 days) after receipt of the second vaccine dose among 1,896 u.s. veterans at five veterans affairs medical centers (vamcs) during february 1-september 30, 2021. adjusted ve 14-119 days following second moderna vaccine dose was 89.6% (95% ci = 80.1%-94.5%) and after the second pfizer-biontech dose was 86.0% (95% ci = 77.6%-91.3%); at ≥120 days ve was 86.1% (95% ci = 77.7%-91.3%) for moderna and 75.1% (95% ci = 64.6%-82.4%) for pfizer-biontech. antibody levels were significantly higher among moderna recipients than pfizer-biontech recipients across all age groups and periods since vaccination; however, antibody levels among recipients of both products declined between 14-119 days and ≥120 days. this case series reports the safety and immunogenicity of a graded administration of the second dose of the moderna and pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccines in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the first dose. both pfizer and moderna vaccines are mrna-based vaccines, and are estimated to have an efficacy rate of more than 94%. 
  CoVID 19 is known to create blood clotting & thickening. Your kidneys are a filter for your blood so when this happens your blood literally clogs your kidneys and causes kidney failure.  Many CoVID patients are on renal meds or dialysis. I am so sorry for your loss! This is real! [SEP] the novel coronavirus is not only causing respiratory problems, but it may also damage the heart, kidneys, liver, and other organs; in wuhan, 14 to 30% of covid-19 patients have lost their kidney function and now require either dialysis or kidney transplants. in this regard, covid-19 can damage the kidneys and increase a patient's risk of requiring dialysis. available evidence suggests that renal involvement in covid-19 infection is not uncommon, and there has been an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease related to the pandemic. in this literature analysis, we address covid-19 and its effects on the renal system, including the pathophysiologic mechanisms. this review looks at the burden and influence of the covid-19 pandemic on the kidneys and on the implications it will have on public health planning. challenges: many extrapulmonary manifestations commonly occur, and a substantial proportion of patients with severe covid-19 exhibit signs of kidney damage. as an important organ of hemofiltration metabolism, the kidney is prone to blockage and destruction when filter high inflammatory and high viscous blood of covid-19, resulting in the loss of a large amount of protein, aggravating blood concentration, and then worsening covid-19 hypercoagulability, which may explain the phenomenon of erythrocytes aggregation blocking the capillary lumen and the main reason why the kidney has become the second largest involvement organs. patients with kidney failure are at an increased risk of progression to a severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) with high mortality. the current analysis was aimed to assess the impact of renal failure on the severity of covid-19 and identify the risk factors of the fatal outcome in this population. underlying kidney disease in patients with covid-19 is among the leading factors associated with a higher risk of severe clinical presentation and increased mortality rate. 
  1.) They take away the most important part of our communication: mimic and body language in general. 2.) The humid, warm environment behind the masks can cause bacterial pneumonia, which in turn can lead to Corona disease. 1/2 [SEP] subjective and physiological responses were obtained from six subjects wearing a ventilated face mask while exercising (3.8 met) for 15 min on a bicycle ergometer. different combinations of ambient air temperatures (7 degrees, 16 degrees, 25 degrees c) and mask air temperatures (22 degrees, 27 degrees, 33 degrees c) were studied together with two different air humidities inside the mask (61% and 86% rh). the subject's acceptance of the mask and thermal environment, thermal sensation, sensations of discomfort, sweating and skin wettedness, and their judgment of the work of breathing were assessed at the end of the 15 min exercise period. the acceptance of both the ambient thermal environment and of the thermal microclimate in the mask primarily was determined by the ambient air temperature, but it was influenced by the air temperature and humidity inside the mask. in the warm environment a mask air temperature less than or equal to 27 degrees c was 100% acceptable and increased the acceptance of thermal environment. the humidity content of the mask air was only important when the mask air was warm. warm humid air significantly decreased acceptance of the mask conditions. the accumulation of sweat inside a full-facepiece respirator mask and the rise in facial skin temperature can be important factors for acceptability of respirators worn in the heat. the results indicate that a large amount of sweat could accumulate inside the mask over a typical 8-hour day. average facial skin temperature was found to rise about 2 degrees c over the 90-minutes test, and this rise could likely be the cause of the very uncomfortable rating given to the respirator. 
 I'm not trying to make comparisons, I'm trying to point out that saying the vaccine can cause serious side effects is a bit hypocritical coming from a guy who's been trivialising covid all year when many of us have had long term illness from that. I wasn't trying to cause offence [SEP] the covid-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has resulted in high mortality and morbidity worldwide and is still a growing problem. moreover, following the emergence of several covid vaccines, there are concerns regarding vaccine effectiveness and possible side effects in such patients. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), causes serious respiratory illness manifesting as pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. evidence suggests that both covid-19 and tuberculosis have a synergistic relationship, boosting detrimental effect of each other, disrupting existing health care models, and also worsening the clinical outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. this review aims to draw attention towards this pertinent clinical issue, and tries to unravel the intricate relationship between covid-19 and tuberculosis, as also the role of bcg vaccination to combat the covid-19 pandemic. vaccinations cause controversies for numerous reasons: medical, religious, and even personal. the following paper focuses on one more, underestimated conflict between individual autonomy and public health in regard to obligatory childhood vaccinations. every medical intervention should be preceded by informed consent; however, informed consent in the case of obligatory vaccinations cannot be voluntary and valid. our paper tries to accentuate the issue of involuntariness and invalidity of informed consent in the case of obligatory vaccination and tries to propose a solution that acknowledges requirements for vaccinations and makes parents feel safer coming in and out of a vaccination visit. pathogenic microorganisms, particularly pathogenic bacteria that cause debilitating diseases, are considered a threat for human health and well-being. 
Fighting stigma —  Covid-19 Impact On Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Market 2020, SWOT Analysis, New ...: Alzheimer's disease is a condition most common in people of 65 years or above age. This disease causes confusing reactions like the confusion ... https://t.co/sFZNcRossl [SEP] this article describes the public health impact of alzheimer's disease (ad), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from ad in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the united states and the fifth-leading cause of death among americans age 65 and older. today, someone in the country develops alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. alzheimer's disease (ad) is a stigmatised condition popularly assumed to be a death sentence for diagnosed individuals. one reason for the rise in the prevalence of alzheimer's disease (ad) since the 1980s is the new association between the disease and aging. this paper explores the current representations of ad, questioning their relationships to aging, thanks to a literature review of 49 articles published in french and in english between 1995 and june 2010. aging appears to be a concurrent diagnosis for ad, both for the lay public and for health professionals, but this confusion, which can be interpreted as a lack of medicalization of memory loss on the conceptual level, does not necessarily constitute an obstacle to medical intervention. moreover, elderly people with ad are subjected to both the persisting stigmas of aging and of dementia as well as, for most of them, that of feminine cognitive incompetence. as the most common form of senile dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad) is accompanied by a great deal of uncertainty which can lead to fear and stigma for those identified with this devastating disease. to investigate how vulnerable populations are affected by the pandemic, we focused on alzheimer's disease, a vector to understanding how the virus has impacted ad progression and risk via aging. 
And any other virus, disease. Apparently this has been the first year with zero deaths of heart disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer. All deaths were caused by covid.🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/GIoqfeaWNR [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus that was identified in december 2019. the findings from the case reports and case series indicate that the risk of death or severe disease from covid-19 in hiv positive patients was lower than observed in the general population, which may indicate a possible protective effect of uncontrolled hiv in preventing the complications associated with the massive inflammatory response. in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) mortality has decreased substantially among human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected people with access to haart, but there are concerns regarding co-morbidities and adverse effects of haart, which may impair vital prognosis. the main underlying causes of death were aids-related (47%, non-hodgkin's lymphoma: 23%), viral hepatitis (11%, hepatitis c: 9%, hepatitis b: 2%), cancer not related to aids or hepatitis (11%), cardiovascular disease (7%), bacterial infections (6%), suicide (4%), and adverse effect of antiretroviral treatments (1%). heart disease was the leading cause of death, with cancers, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertensive disease also among the top five causes in most years. during the period 1985-2000, countries experienced an increase in mortality due to non-communicable diseases, aids and assaults (homicides); the latter two causes were most common among the 15-44 year age group. to assess the effect of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) epidemic on mortality in us children younger than 15 years of age and to identify associated causes of death, the authors examined final national mortality statistics for 1988, the most recent year for which such data are available. during 2007-2011, non-hiv-attributable causes of death with the highest rates per 1,000 person-years were heart disease (2.0), non-aids cancers other than lung cancer (1.4), and accidents (0.8). among hiv-infected persons, as rates of death due to hiv-attributable causes decreased, rates due to non-hiv-attributable causes also decreased, but the percentages of deaths due to non-hiv-attributable causes, such as heart disease and non-aids cancers increased. in this review, we further explore the unique dynamic of hiv/aids in the context of the worldwide covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of vaccines as a protective measure against covid-19, as well as what immune parameters and safeguards should be monitored in this immunocompromised group following vaccination. 
Maybe mRNA vaccines caused rare heart inflammation in some teens. "The CDC hasn’t determined if there’s really a link to the shots, and continues to urge that everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against Covid-19, which is far riskier than the vaccine." https://t.co/RH3rquGcMV [SEP] after reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mrna vaccine recipients,¶ which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an acip meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mrna covid-19 vaccination in the united states. on june 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis, acip determined that the benefits of using mrna covid-19 vaccines under the fda's eua clearly outweigh the risks in all populations, including adolescents and young adults. background it is unknown if the efficacy of the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) vaccine is affected by the co-administration of other vaccines. as of july 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the united states had received at least 1 dose of covid-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after covid-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of covid-19 vaccines. one (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccination or moderna covid-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mrna covid-19 vaccination. during the most recent meeting in july 2021, acip determined that, overall, the benefits of covid-19 vaccination in preventing covid-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the covid-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. to determine the effects of covid-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. the small elevations in cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to exercise after the pfizer mrna vaccine regimen could have implications for athletes at the elite level and warrants investigation. 
    I've a connective tissue disease and autoimmune that both cause massive problems with teeth. W/ Covid I can't risk going to the dentist (can't afford to anyway... great health coverage, NO dental). You can only see one of the four that are broke...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fucking embarrassing. Hate it. https://t.co/HWw6HxKSdv [SEP] reasons most commonly cited for not seeing a dentist were no perceived reason to go (37.2%), cost (30.7%), and fear (9.2%). over 50 percent of respondents had not attended a dentist in over 36 months, for the reasons that 'i have no problem or need for treatment' (62%) and 'i have no teeth, and therefore i have no need to go' (54%). while it is common to assume that no teeth means no need to see a dentist, research shows that regular dental visits are vital for ensuring the early screening of oral cancer and other mucosal pathologies, and the optimisation of existing rosthesis/restorations. the findings indicate that although most of the people were not satisfied with condition of oral health and describe their condition of teeth as fairly poor and mostly visited the dentist when they are in pain. most of the population do neither have appointment to see a dentist nor they ought to go to a dentist for check up very soon .many people think that their teeth need to be cleaned by dentist. as a pathogen spread primarily by the respiratory route covid-19 infection not only poses significant risks to health care workers, but to dentists and dental health care workers, owing to the potential prolonged exposure and proximity to patients. most older people living in long-term care will only see a dentist if they have a problem, although staff have regular dental check-ups for their own teeth. not seeing a dentist within the last 12 months increased risk 30-50% compared with seeing a dentist two or more times. findings suggest that homeless patients have overall poor daily dental care and experience significant dental problems due to a range of lifestyle factors. barriers to care included fear, embarrassment, lack of money, living chaotic lifestyles, not prioritising dental care and difficulties finding an nhs dentist that would take on homeless people. 
The atmospheric pressure this day is kept at a level that will cause discomfort in people with problems related to the locomotor, cardiovascular, eye, brain, and nervous systems. Remember that due to COVID-19 you can also be affected due to your compromised immune system. https://t.co/0PhwEKpCBR [SEP] various clinical features related to the central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns) due to covid-19 infection are now identified. recent studies show that covid-19 can directly or indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially causing neurological pathologies such as alzheimer disease and parkinson disease. thus, chronic covid-19-related disease processes have the potential to cause serious mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. these consequences may have serious social impacts on the future of covid-19 survivors. minor neurological symptoms such as anosmia are relatively common manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). here we present a case of a 66-year-old man with bipolar disorder and moderate respiratory covid-19 symptoms who presented to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness. the acute phase of covid-19 has been also related to nervous system symptoms, including loss of taste and smell as well as encephalitis and cerebrovascular disorders. this review article aims to give an overview of the current neurological symptoms associated with covid-19, as well as attempting to provide an insight beyond the acute affectation. epidemiological studies found that exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (pm) causes severe health problems in human and significant damage to the physiological systems. in recent days, pm exposure could be related as a carrier for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus transmission and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection. 
 I received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and had side effects with a fever. That side effect is also cause to self isolate and get a Covid test as per the screening tool and Health Links.  What should people having vaccine side effects do? [SEP] the respondents were asked about the side effects after the first and second doses of the vaccines, such as injection site pain, arm pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, and fatigue. generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). young aged participants, females, participants with history of covid19 infection, those with comorbid diseases and astrazeneca vaccine receivers were statistically significant risk factors for having adverse reactions post vaccination, p value (0.03, 0.028, 0.007, 0.019 and 0.0001) respectively. side effects after receiving the first dose of the vaccine were reported by most participants (89.9%) and included pain at the injection site (78.4%), fatigue (51.8%), myalgia (37.6%), headache (33.1%), and chills (32.3%). more side effects were significantly associated with astrazeneca vaccine (p < .001). the majority of participants (37.07%, 231/623) reported swelling and pain at the injection site and fever (25.84%, 162/623); these were some of the common localized and generalized symptoms after the covid-19 vaccine administration. however, as a significant number of the population began to receive various covid-19 vaccines, reports of various other moderate to severe side effects have now started to emerge. however, the covid-19 mrna vaccines frequently cause systemic side effects shortly after the injection, such as fever, headache and generalized fatigue. methods we distributed a questionnaire in jordan among physicians, dentists and nurses who received a covid-19 vaccine to explore the side effects (se) they encountered after the first or the second dose of one of three vaccines namely: astrazeneca vaxzevria (az), pfizer-bionteck (pb), and sinopharm (sp) vaccines. side effects associated with covid-19 vaccines have been reported by 60% of the study subjects, and most of them reported fatigue (90%), pain at the site of the injections (85%). 
some insight, covid-19 is the name of the disease, not the virus. the virus' name is SARS-CoV 2. just like how HIV is the name of the virus that causes AIDS, and rubeola the virus that causes the measles :D [SEP] the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is caused by the newest sars virus, sars-cov-2, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded rna betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae. coronavirus disease 2019 named as covid-19 imposing a huge burden on public health as well as global economies, is caused by a new strain of betacoronavirus named as sars-cov-2. the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in wuhan (china) named as corona virus disease 19(covid-19) caused by the novel corona virus sars-cov-2 has caused hundreds of thousands of mortalities across the world ,while the mortality rate is in millions, leading it to be declared as a global pandemic. naming the coronavirus disease (covid-19) and the virus that causes it. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it] and is responsible for the covid-19 pandemic is another in a long line of coronavirus outbreak - and unlikely to be the last. later, the pneumonia was associated with a new coronavirus; in february 2020, the world health organization (who) gave the name covid-19 to the new disease, while the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv) gave the name sars-cov-2 to the virus causing it. in this review, we summarize the relevant information about the origin and spread of sars-cov-2, its epidemiology and diagnostics, and the clinical course and treatment of covid-19. sars-cov-2 is a new virus that belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus; viruses in this subgenus have spread widely in the previous years and caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndromes. in december 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee for taxonomy of viruses, and the disease it causes named covid-19 by the world health organization. the disease caused by this virus was named as a new coronavirus disease: covid-19. 
  It actually is worse than the corona virus that causes the common cold. https://t.co/nlukW9crPA [SEP] corona viruses cause common cold, and infections caused by corona viruses are generally self-resolving. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is the name given by the world health organization (who) to the highly contagious and infectious disease caused by the novel corona virus or sars-cov-2, which was first reported on 31 december 2019 in wuhan city of the capital of china's hubei province. historically, first coronavirus had surfaced in 1965 with symptoms of common cold. indeed covid-19 has turned out to be the most lethal of all coronaviruses as it has infected at least three million people killing more than two hundred thousands of them in the first 4 months of its spread. the new coronavirus is spreading rapidly around the world these days, and many countries are heavily infected with it. corona is a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections, from the common cold to the sars epidemic that broke out in 2003, and now the newest member of the family (sars-cov-2) is present in iran. according to the world health organization (who) (2020b), coronaviruses refer to a large family of viruses known to be zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and cause a variety of illnesses from the common cold to more concerning diseases such as severe lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis). the potential community health risk caused by the current coronavirus (2019-ncov) is high for young children, older adults, persons with comorbid cardiac or respiratory diseases, and immunocompromised individuals because their immune systems may be weak, making them more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus. in humans, coronaviruses can cause infections of the respiratory system, with damage of varying severity depending on the virus examined: ranging from mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. ), thus definitively named the new coronavirus as sars-cov-2. 
   Lots of things can cause heart failure. Could be hereditary.  Could be stress, diet or all of the above. There is no conclusive evidence that COVID alone causes heart failure in healthy people. [SEP] in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, covid-19 also causes heart failure (hf). covid-19-induced hf is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1β; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-α) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia. the purpose of this review is to stress the complicated interactions between the microbiota and the development of heart failure. altered gut microbial communities contribute to heart failure through bacterial translocation or affecting multiple metabolic pathways, including the trimethylamine/tmao, scfa, bile acid, and uremic toxin pathways. we conclude that dd patients show a disease specific increased risk of heart failure which should be taken into account in patient management. although previous studies suggested that oxidative stress plays a pathological role in the development of heart failure, no direct evidence has been documented so far. from the moment of heart failure appearance, the prognosis is poor. however, heart failure greatly enhanced the cortisol and total glucocorticoid responses to acute stress, but not that of corticosterone. second, ill health, in the form of severe heart failure in cm hamsters and very old age in health hamsters, decreases adrenocortical function. at the same time, heart failure greatly enhances cortisol responses to acute stress. 
   The vast majority had conditions such as respiratory failure, blood clots and stroke, which can be caused by the coronavirus itself. Others had underlying diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, sepsis and diabetes, possibly preexisting conditions [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZOGcpcSLOe [SEP] blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 infection. remarkably, more than 70% of deaths related to covid-19 are attributed to clotting-associated complications such as pulmonary embolism, strokes and multi-organ failure. we report findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe covid-19. our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to covid-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. we therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of covid-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death. the virus primarily affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts and raises the risk of a variety of non-pulmonary consequences, the most severe and possibly fatal of which are cardiovascular problems. data show that almost one-third of the patients with a moderate or severe form of covid-19 had preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, heart failure, or coronary artery disease. sars-cov2 causes hyper inflammation, hypoxia, apoptosis, and a renin-angiotensin system imbalance in a variety of cell types, primarily endothelial cells. profound endothelial dysfunction associated with covid-19 can be the cause of impaired organ perfusion that may generate acute myocardial injury, renal failure, and a procoagulant state resulting in thromboembolic events. the presence of any underlying heart condition could influence outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
      Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Info from Mayo Clinic [SEP] here, we review the currently available evidence to discuss the plausible immunologic pathways that may contribute to the development of covid-19 neurological complications, namely alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, guillain-barre syndrome, seizure, and brainstem involvement. anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). finally, there is concern that covid-19 may be associated with secondary illnesses, such as guillain-barre, and may even contribute to the development of diseases, such as alzheimer's. in this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the sars-cov-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. the neurological symptoms associated with covid-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and guillain-barre syndrome along with many others. covid-19 infection can show various manifestation, including neurologic manifestations, such as anosmia, ageusia, or dysgeusia, and causes the neurologic disorder such as stroke, guillain-barre syndrome, encephalopathy, and many more. covid-19 also affects the brain, which may result in a global or focal neurologic manifestation. occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations (encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, guillain-barrè syndrome) is increasingly reported in patients with covid-19. numerous emerging reports have demonstrated that the covid-19 has detrimental effects on neurological functions, and can lead to severe impairment of the central nervous system (cns). the neurological manifestations linked with covid-19 include headache, anosmia, encephalitis, epileptic seizures, guillain-barre syndrome, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage alongwith multiple others complications. 
When delhi govt solve the problem of mosquito in delhi full night we not able to sleep and it's also cause malaria pls see on this matter also either one side is corona and second side is malaria infection pls help [SEP] malaria is a major public health problem in india. the study was conducted to improve the management of malaria by iec and training activities in slum areas of delhi. mosquito borne diseases (mbds) are major public health problem in india. state of delhi is endemic for dengue and other mbds. in view of this, efficacy of zerofly® , an insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting (factory treated with deltamethrin 2.0 g/kg or 265 mg/m2 ) was evaluated for its efficacy against malaria vectors and its impact on malaria incidence in temporary labour settlements in two urban areas in india. baseline studies on the susceptibility of mosquitoes in delhi and noida areas revealed 100% susceptibility of the malaria vector species anopheles culicifacies and an. results of the present study revealed that zerofly® plastic sheeting is highly effective in reducing the indoor resting density of mosquitoes, man -vector contact and malaria incidences in labour populations living in temporary shelters. the results of present study indicated that synchronization of encounters between inhabitants and mosquito vectors was caused by poor self-protection and sleeping behavior of inhabitants. one is the application of rs on the mosquito production in the sanjay lake and surrounding areas in delhi. when impregnated with long-lasting insecticide formulations they also repel or kill mosquitoes attempting to feed upon sleeping humans, and can even suppress entire populations of malaria vectors that feed predominantly upon humans. 
   Incidentally, the 400k Of Covid deaths are phony too!!! The fact is 1/2 of those at least were actually caused by something else (diabetes, heart diseases, etc.) as there was/still is insurance insensitives; BIG $ to code as Covid. Here’s a unique example; one month the Covid~ [SEP] overall 10,222 deaths were registered in march-april 2020, corresponding to a 24% increase compared to the previous two years. based on the ucod, the increases in mortality were observed for covid and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. background: in italy, during the first epidemic wave of 2020, the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mortality was reached at the end of march. in the early pandemic, there were so many false and misinformation about herbal that can cure covid-19. the aim of the present study was to examine death certificates of persons who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) to (a) quantify the number of deaths directly caused by coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); (b) estimate the most common complications leading to death; and (c) identify the most common comorbidities. approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to covid-19 on death certificates reported to cdc (1). concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to covid-19 (2). analysis of international classification of diseases, tenth revision (icd-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported covid-19 deaths are being overestimated. these findings support the accuracy of covid-19 mortality surveillance in the united states using official death certificates. accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, and of covid-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action. 
 I want to know why long covid can get immediate recognition and treatment....an infection that can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Just like PANS and PANDAS! Yet, PANS PANDAS families are being hurled into the pits of neglect by your dangerous consensus statement [SEP] while underlying infectious and inflammatory processes in pans and pandas patients are treated, psychiatric and behavioral symptoms need simultaneous treatment to decrease suffering and improve adherence to therapeutic intervention. to date, 75.0% of pandas patients (n = 258) have shown an improvement of neurologic symptoms, mainly observed within 3-5 months of treatment for pandas cases, while 88.4% of pans patients (n = 23) have improved after 6-12 months. conclusions: our study has confirmed the usefulness of the preliminary diagnostic criteria for pandas and pans, revealing also the importance of early diagnosis to reduce the risk of evolution toward disabling chronic neurologic sequelae. pandas-related disorders, including pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (pans), childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (cans), and pediatric infection triggered autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (pitands), have also been described. since first defined in 1998, paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (pandas) and its later, broader iteration, paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (pans), have garnered significant attention and controversy. in this paper, we review current working definitions of pandas/pans, discuss published evidence for interventions related to this entity, and propose a clinical approach to children presenting with acute symptoms satisfying criteria for pandas/pans. objectives: whether pans (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) and pandas (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) represent true clinical entities is debated and data for a characteristic phenotype are still controversial. methods: patients fulfilling a clinical diagnosis of pans or pandas from 2014 to 2017 were enrolled. clinical presentation of pans children showed statistically significant differences compared with both pandas and sc, in particular, with the presence of obsessive symptoms, behavioral regression, and somatic symptoms in the first group. until today there is a large debate about the existence of pandas (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) or pans (pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome). 
Some of the severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 seem to result from the activity of specific immune cells, which can cause long-term inflammation of the lungs. [SEP] current covid-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to covid-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) causes an uncontrolled activation of the innate immune response, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of covid-19 related deaths. the importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and covid-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in il-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. select mirnas can regulate inflammation in covid-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. if the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. however, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of covid-19 patients remains to be elucidated. sars-cov-2 is a respiratory coronavirus that causes covid-19, and injury to the lungs is expected; however, there is often damage to numerous other cells and organs, leading to an array of symptoms. sars-cov2 infects respiratory epithelial cells via its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, causing a viral pneumonia with pronounced inflammation resulting in significant damage to the lungs and other organ systems, including the kidneys, though symptoms and disease severity are quite variable depending on the intensity of exposure and presence of underlying conditions that may affect the immune response. 
  Interesting thing about Covid is that it can cause pneumonia, where as pneumonia doesn't cause Covid. [SEP] influenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus frequently cause viral pneumonia, an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in the extreme ages of life. during the last two decades, three outbreaks of coronavirus-associated pneumonia, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome, middle-east respiratory syndrome, and the ongoing coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (covid-19) were reported. in conclusion, viral pneumonia is a relevant cause of cap, whose interest is increasing due to the current covid-19 outbreak. although pneumothorax is a well-known complication of covid-19 pneumonia especially in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, bronchopleural fistula causing persistent pneumothorax in sole covid-19 pneumonia is extremely rare. the purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of covid-19 in children compared with those of other sources of viral pneumonia diagnosed during the covid-19 outbreak. the symptoms and severity of covid-19 pneumonia in children were no more severe than those in children with other viral pneumonia. the patients were divided into covid-19 with pneumonia and without pneumonia. compared with covid-19 without pneumonia, covid-19 with pneumonia had significantly higher serum interleukin (il)-2r, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α. elevation of circulating cytokines was significantly associated with presence of pneumonia in covid-19 and the severity of lung injury in covid-19 pneumonia. in december 2019, an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged called covid-19. 
Why was handcock pumping this into Covid patients![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Midazolam injection may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems such as shallow, slowed, or temporarily stopped breathing that may lead to permanent brain injury or death? [SEP] the increasing use of opioids (e.g., fentanyl, carfentanil) for illicit drug manufacturing poses a potential life-threatening hazard to law enforcement officers and first responders (e.g., ems, fire and rescue) who may unknowingly come into contact with these drugs during the course of their daily activities. the most serious adverse effect of opioid exposure is respiratory depression leading to slow, shallow breathing or complete cessation of voluntary breathing (respiratory arrest). this clinical update describes the potential risks associated with opioid exposure as well as the use of naloxone as it pertains to the opk9. regular breathing of newborn lambs was recorded, and it was noted how the breathing was affected when blood, with the aid of a roller pump, was infused from the umbilical arteries into the umbilical veins. this series of patients draws attention to respiratory distress as a potentially serious, even life-threatening, complication of dystonia. sixty-one patients met the audit criteria: the commonest problem was shortness of breath (57.5%), which was generally controlled with conservative doses of morphine (10-20 mg/24 h via a syringe pump). this meant that the patient had stopped breathing, his heart had stopped beating, there was unresponsiveness, his body had turned cold and finally rigor mortis had set in. however, this treatment modality may cause life-threatening complications. the patient had respiratory difficulty followed by a generalized seizure and developed coma minutes after the drug administration. therefore, physicians should be mindful of the possibility of life-threatening complications that may develop and lead to a patient's death if proper treatment is not performed. 
Apparently COVID can cause hair loss...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So that’s cool... [SEP] the aim of this study was to establish the effectiveness of scalp cooling in preventing alopecia for patients with breast cancer who received the trial combination chemotherapy of epirubicin and docetaxel. doubt remains about the general effectiveness of scalp cooling in preventing hair loss for patients receiving chemotherapy. nurses assessed participants' hair loss using a modified version of the who scale at seven time points and also recorded hair loss photographically. patients self-reported in relation to overall hair loss, hair condition, levels of emotional upset, negativity about appearance, hair re-growth and wig use. significantly greater hair loss was apparent in the control group during most of the treatment period. damage to hair follicles following exposure to toxic chemotherapeutics can cause substantial hair loss, commonly known as chemotherapy-induced alopecia (cia). preventive therapies remain limited; however, recent advances in the use of scalp cooling technologies have proved successful in preventing or reducing hair loss in some patients. further improvements in scalp cooling efficacy and/or development of novel treatments to prevent chemotherapy-induced hair loss are required. to achieve this, post-chemotherapy assessment of hair follicle damage markers, with and without scalp cooling, would provide invaluable mechanistic and prognostic information. this article describes the potential utility of a combination of biomarkers in assessing drug-induced alopecia and the protective potential of existing or new treatments. 
#Neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia increase the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and dying from the disease. For people with Alzheimer's the risk is three times greater. It can be six times greater if they are over 80 https://t.co/sxQ21lyfhu #science [SEP] dementia has been associated with covid-19 prevalence, but whether this reflects higher infection, older age of patients, or disease severity remains unclear. all-cause dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad), and parkinson's disease (pd) were associated with covid-19-positive diagnosis, and all-cause dementia and ad remained associated in individuals ≥ 80 years old. all-cause dementia and ad increased the risk of covid-19-related death, and all-cause dementia was uniquely associated with increased death in ≥ 80-year-old patients. all-cause dementia and ad are age-independent risk factors for disease severity and death in covid-19. the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, led us to investigate the links between neurodegeneration and covid-19. we show that a pre-existing diagnosis of alzheimer's disease predicts the highest risk of covid-19 and mortality among elderly individuals. patients with dementia including alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting parkinson's disease are not. viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, and ms, suggesting that covid-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. since patients with alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of covid-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population. by assessing the effect of covid-19 on ad patients, we explore genetics, metabolism, and lifestyle factors in both covid-19 and alzheimer's disease that can work synergistically to precipitate adverse outcomes. 
 There are studies that address that. Look up Fibromyalgia & MD in Newton, Ma. I don't go along w/his tx regimen, but he championed that, 'of course chronic illness can CAUSE depression/anxiety' & had been proven(some classic Minnesota study).Also, HCPs doubting your sick contribs [SEP] the aim of this study is to investigate childhood traumatic experiences, anxiety, and depression levels in patients with fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, which are diseases that cause chronic pain. patients with fibromyalgia reported significantly higher scores for ctq emotional abuse and had depression compared with healthy controls. patients with fibromyalgia reported significantly higher scores for had anxiety than both healthy controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders and are the cause of a large and increasing amount of sick-leave in most developed countries. in this study we addressed, whether sick leave due to anxiety, depression or comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with increased risk of retirement due to permanent disability and increased mortality in a cohort of german workers. outpatient-managed depression/anxiety-related sick leave was significantly associated with higher permanent disability (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)) 1.48 (1.30, 1.69) for depression, 1.25 (1.07, 1.45) for anxiety, 1.91 (1.56, 2.35) for both). individuals with cfs/fibromyalgia often display stress-related biological alterations and the experience of stressful life events has been associated with illness development. the present study demonstrated that women with cfs/fibromyalgia (n = 40) as well as community participants who were depressed/anxious (n = 37), reported higher stigma levels than healthy women (n = 33). moreover, women with cfs/fibromyalgia and those with depression/anxiety also reported greater levels of stigma than women with a chronic yet more widely accepted condition (n = 35; rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and multiple sclerosis). fibromyalgia frequently is accompanied by anxiety and depression, making this illness difficult to diagnose and treat. 
     There's a really fact based answer for that. And the covid vaccine trials started in April 2020. So it's been over a year. And mRNA vaccines can't cause autoimmune diseases (although they may be dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases.) [SEP] recently, the covid-19 pandemic created concerns about immunosuppression in autoimmunity, leading to cessation or a delay in immunotherapy treatments. in december 2020, france began vaccinations using the messenger rna (mrna) vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) to combat the sars-cov-2 pandemic. this review aimed to examine covid-19 vaccine candidates using rna technology and compile its current data. this case suggests that mrna covid-19 vaccination may cause an autoimmune disorder. physicians should be aware of this adverse reaction by mrna covid-19 vaccination and should consider the benefits and risks of vaccination for each recipient. vaccination against sars-cov-2 could also trigger auto-immunity, as it has been described with other vaccines. we report the case of a 76-year-old woman with hashimoto thyroiditis and prior covid-19 infection who developed severe autoimmune hepatitis (with typical features including strongly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody and markedly elevated immunoglobulins g, as well as typical histological findings) following sars-cov-2 vaccination (mrna-1273 sars-cov-2 vaccine, moderna®). the association is not absolute, but given the novelty of covid-19 and the mrna covid-19 vaccine and the relapse timing, it leads us to pose this hypothesis. this case report exemplifies potential safety issues that may be encountered with new vaccine administration in patients with recent covid-19 and underlying autoimmune disease. brand new anti-covid-19 vaccines have been developed and made available in <1-year from the viral sequence publication. 
  That's not true at all. Overlooking the fact that western medicine tends to treat symptoms not causes, the Covid vaccine, like all vaccines, work by helping your body identify the virus & create antibodies to protect you from infection. Your comments do nothing but spread fear. [SEP] however, the development of a vaccine will help control the impact of covid-19. this could improve consciousness, give women a better vaccination experience, enhance their willingness to vaccinate, and protect them from covid-19 infection. since its emergence, extensive prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures have been employed to successfully prevent the spread of covid-19. in december 2020, the first vaccine against sars-cov-2 was approved by the world health organization (who) and, subsequently, many other vaccines were approved for use by different international regulators in different countries. in this manuscript, we discuss the different monoclonal antibody and vaccine therapies available against covid-19 and how the efficacy of these therapies is affected by the emergence of variants of sars-cov-2. covid-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, spreading rapidly worldwide. therefore, using rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to identify the virus and subsequently select appropriate and effective treatments can help improvement of patients and control the pandemic. the present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against sars-cov-2 by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by mhc class i. in this study, we demonstrate that vaccination with the 2009 pandemic h1n1 vaccine elicits 1918 virus cross-protective antibodies in mice and humans, and that vaccination or passive transfer of human-positive sera reduced morbidity and conferred full protection from lethal challenge with the 1918 virus in mice. in this review article, we describe the underlying molecular organization and phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses, including the sars-cov-2, and recent advances in diagnosis and vaccine development in brief and focusing mainly on developing potential therapeutic options that can be explored to manage this pandemic virus infection, which would help in valid countering of covid-19. 
There are hints that pple who have serious COVID-19 mount the strongest responses, just as in the 2 other serious human diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe  SARS & MERS Both trigger high antibody levels that last up to 2 years, & T cell responses to SARS can be detected even [SEP] in this article, the immune responses of covid-19 patients are reviewed. as sars-cov-2 has many characteristics in common with two other viruses, sars-cov that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and mers-cov (middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus) that causes middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), the experiences learned from the use of passive immunity in treatment can be applied to covid-19. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a newly emerged human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). as covid-19 causes serious public health concerns across the world, investigating the characteristics of sars-cov-2 and its interaction with the host immune responses may provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes disease in some individuals. in the present paper, we have reviewed the immune responses (including the innate and adaptive immunities) to sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2, so as to improve our understanding of the concept of the covid-19 disease, which will be helpful in developing vaccines and medications for treating the covid-19 patients. patients with covid-19 mounted a mostly type-specific sars-cov-2 response. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health. as with sars-cov, covid-19 causing sars-cov-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than sars and mers. the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the illness caused by sars-cov‑2, is highly variable. in this review, the sars-cov‑2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of covid-19 are described. 
 You literally missed the point of everything I said. Mild infections will not cause long term lung damage. That’s it. Infections, viral or otherwise, causing vasculitis and thrombosis, is nothing new. Only thing new is greater % of severe infections with Covid19. [SEP] this unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the cns. the clinical manifestations may be mild, but if severe, includes acute encephalitic and pulmonary syndromes with a high mortality. compromised lung function is a feature of both infection driven and non-infective pathologies. viral infections-including the current pandemic strain sars-cov-2-that affect lung function can cause both acute and long-term chronic damage. respiratory viruses are opportunistic pathogens that infect the upper respiratory tract in humans and cause severe illnesses, especially in vulnerable populations. the new "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (sars-cov-2) is one of the respiratory viruses causing highly acute lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) with clinical similarities to those reported in "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"(sars-cov) and the "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus"(mers-cov) including neurological manifestation. while the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases, individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. evidence suggests that severe outcomes in covid19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. evidence suggests that severe outcomes in covid19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. 
The ignorant and misinformed people on this thread!! Let’s tell our 18 year olds not to get a vaccine because of side effects, leaving them open to getting a disease which can potentially cause long Covid and problems for months after! Great parenting there!! 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/6FR5dTPFOg [SEP] this study examines people's intention to get covid-19 vaccines and some of the psychological factors, that can facilitate the vaccination process. belief in covid-19-related misinformation and vaccine confidence were added to the tpb framework in order to comprehensively assess the predictors of covid-19 vaccine intentions. belief in covid-19-related misinformation and vaccine confidence, on the other hand, had no significant impact on the intention to get covid-19 vaccines. we found that the intention to get vaccinated or intake of the covid-19 vaccine were positively related to the perceptions of becoming infected, perceptions of the severity of the potential long-term effects, the vaccine's efficacy, and the benefits of vaccination. meanwhile, the intention to get the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by perceptions of the negative side-effects and the general impediments to vaccination. given the urgent global need for vaccinating individuals of all ages against the covid-19 pandemic, understanding the extent and reasons for parents' willingness to get their children vaccinated is important. these findings indicate that some groups of individuals may be more vaccination hesitant because they are more concerned about vaccine safety than covid-19 infection. based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from covid-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. people around the world look hesitant to get the coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) vaccine. the potential harmful side effects of a covid-19 vaccine was the main reason for vaccine hesitancy. 
We may see a flood of patients with memory loss or even #Alzheimers in a few years; #COVID19 can cause major problems in the brain that look similar to #TBI or #Alzheimers disease.  https://t.co/fhtlPKk9yg [SEP] alzheimer's disease (ad) is associated with dementia, and it is also a memory syndrome in the brain. ad is now becoming an increasing and important brain disease. the changes in a person's brain after a few years are noticeable through symptoms such as language difficulties and memory loss. more than 100 years ago, alois alzheimer first described the clinical and pathological features of an unusual brain disease during the meeting of the society of southwest german psychiatrists in tübingen: the patient, auguste deter, suffered memory loss, disorientation, hallucinations and delusions and died at the age of 55. tbi patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. common features of alzheimer's disease include memory loss; difficulty with problem solving, abstractions, and calculations; and language and visuospatial deficits. according to the world health organization, traumatic brain injury (tbi) is the major cause of death and disability and will surpass the other diseases by the year 2020. tbi patients suffer from changes in mood, impulsivity, poor social judgment and memory deficits. besides traumatic brain injury also induces neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration process, and increases risk of dementia. thus, these data suggest that recurrent tbi may cause dp by activating pathological mechanisms similar to those that cause brain degeneration due to accumulations of filamentous tau lesions in ad, and similar, albeit attenuated, activation of these processes by a single tbi may increase susceptibility to sporadic ad decades after the event. 
‘Covid infection can cause liver damage’ https://t.co/bbxcfViujg [SEP] lung injury is the main outcome of covid-19 infection; however, damage can occur in other organs including the liver. this review summarizes the available data on liver test abnormalities in covid-19 patients; critically evaluates the possible causes of liver injury and provides recommendations for clinicians. available data suggest that liver injury in covid-19 patients may result from direct effect by the virus, immune-mediated inflammation or drug-induced toxicity. this study will analyze the causes of liver injury in covid-19 and the influence of liver-related complications on the treatment and prognosis of covid-19. it is hypothesized that liver impairment caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection might play a central role in severe clinical presentations. this review aims to highlight the current frontier of covid-19 infection and liver injury and the direction of liver injury in these patients. recent evidence has shown that an underlying liver disease can also be a risk factor, and sars-cov-2 itself can cause direct or indirect damage to liver tissue through multisystem inflammation generated especially in the more severe stages. different degrees of liver injury or liver dysfunctions have been reported in patients with covid-19 infection. this review also illustrates the possible underlying mechanisms linking covid-19 to liver injury, as well as provides recommendations to prevent liver damage in covid-19 infection. in this translational medicine-based narrative review, we summarize the current data on the possible indirect mechanisms involved in liver damage due to covid-19, the histopathological findings, and the impact of these mechanisms in patients with chronic liver disease. 
#EU #covid #brexit  disagreements re covid vaccines could cause more damage within the Eu than brexit did [SEP] post-brexit, the politically and economically weakened eu and uk risks a detrimental impact on animal protection on an international scale. the second stage of brexit negotiations also collided with the covid-19 pandemic, which has strained economies around the world. the principal effects of brexit on health and health care will fall within the united kingdom, and all forms of brexit have overwhelmingly negative implications for health care and health within the uk. this article focuses on the external effects of brexit ("brexternalities") for health and health care. our model suggests that a no-deal brexit scenario would be the most harmful, generating approximately 12 400 (6690 to 23 390) extra cvd deaths between 2021 and 2030, whereas establishing a free trading agreement with the eu would have a lower impact on mortality, contributing approximately 5740 (2860 to 11 910) extra cvd deaths. trade policy under all modelled brexit scenarios could increase price and decrease intake of f&v, generating substantial additional cvd mortality in england. the process of leaving the european union (eu) will have profound consequences for health and the national health service (nhs) in the uk. in this paper, we use the who health system building blocks framework to assess the likely effects of three scenarios we term soft brexit, hard brexit, and failed brexit. financing of health care for uk citizens in the eu and vice versa is threatened, as is access to some capital funds, while brexit threatens overall economic performance. overall, a soft version of brexit would minimise health threats whereas failed brexit would be the riskiest outcome. 
Yo, why would a vaccine that creates spike proteins smooth muscle contractions cause the kidney to start releasing large amounts of blood clotting compounds in susceptible people? Must be the adenovirus. https://t.co/AvxlcaEDFv  oh https://t.co/A1S4YrLGcP https://t.co/rq8kOxTWhP [SEP] severe covid-19 is often accompanied by coagulopathies such as thrombocytopenia and abnormal clotting. rarely, such complications follow sars-cov-2 vaccination. it is hypothesized that coagulopathies accompanying sars-cov-2 infections and vaccinations result from bacterial co-infections that synergize with virus-induced autoimmunity due to antigenic mimicry of blood proteins by both bacterial and viral antigens. coagulopathies occur mainly in severe covid-19 characterized by bacterial co-infections with streptococci, staphylococci, klebsiella, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. these bacteria express unusually large numbers of antigens mimicking human blood antigens, as do both sars-cov-2 and adenoviruses. sars-cov-2 mimics complement factors, rh antigens, platelet phosphodiesterases, factors ix and x, von willebrand factor (vwf), and vwf protease adamts13. adenoviruses mimic prothrombin and platelet factor 4. bacterial prophylaxis, avoidance of vaccinating bacterially infected individuals, and antigen deletion for vaccines may reduce coagulopathy risk. clotted blood caused large contractions of intact artery strips; it contracted inner much more than outer muscle. this article has been retracted: please see elsevier policy on article withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal). 
Based on few articles, that comparison is incorrect, because covid causes clots in the brain (Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: CVST), while birth control pills cause clots in the legs that travel to the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism) & those are treatable with anticoagulants. [SEP] cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is a rare cause of stroke, occurring when a blood clot forms in any of the brain venous sinuses. acquired or hereditary prothrombotic risk factors may lead to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst), particularly when other predisposing factors coexist. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is a severe clinical condition that manifests with diverse symptoms that can be mild, taking the form of a headache, or can be life-threatening, with raised intracranial pressure and herniation. this paper describes two cases with extensive cvst who presented with progressive neurological deterioration despite adequate systemic anticoagulation treatment. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is an uncommon condition marked by clotting of blood in cerebral venous, dural sinuses, or cortical veins. although pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis have been well described in patients with covid-19 infection, there is a paucity of literature on cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) associated with covid-19 infection. cvst is an uncommon etiology of stroke and has a higher occurrence in women and young people. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is a rare and potentially deadly condition. anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for cvst. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is an infrequent disease (representing around 1% of all strokes) manifested by clotting of blood in cerebral venous or dural sinuses as well as cortical veins. 
 Yeah. & I don’t think they don’t have a Covid vaccine for babies yet so I definitely wouldn’t put it in my body while pregnant. Cause you really don’t even know they effect it’s gonna have on you either. I got mine the other day tho. No side effects except for a sore arm. [SEP] compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. the people in the study who got the vaccine who went on to get covid-19 generally had milder and fewer symptoms than those who got the placebo. after receiving the vaccine, some people experienced pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, and nausea. the covid-19 outbreak represents a massive source of stressful agents for women and their babies during the perinatal period. the covid-19 pandemic has been suggested to potentially have short- and long-term detrimental effects on pregnant women and the baby. for example, it has been informed that women exposed to the 1918 flu pandemic (commonly known as the spanish flu) while pregnant showed higher rates of premature delivery in the short term. long-term consequences have also been reported and individuals (both males and females) who were exposed to the 1918 flu pandemic while in utero had a higher risk of developing schizophrenia, diabetes, coronary heart disease or cancer throughout their lifespan. more women than men reported adverse reactions, especially sore arm, swelling at the site of injection, and itching. although a safe and effective vaccine holds the greatest promise for resolving the covid-19 pandemic, hesitancy to accept vaccines remains common. the probability of minor side effects (50%, 75%, 90%) including fever and sore arm, did not significantly influence likelihood of receiving the vaccine. 
   Sorry but I’m slapping this down really hard. Too much mis info out there as it is. Covid-19 vaccine does NOT cause shingles. It is caused by leftover measles viruses in your body. It’s a very small possibility getting the Covid-19 vaccine can trigger the shingles. [SEP] thirty-six patients 36/45 (80%) developed herpes zoster following the priming dose of covid-19 vaccine among those who received mrna vaccine. we could not establish definite link but there may be possible association between covid-19 vaccine and shingles. herpes zoster (shingles) is a painful and disabling condition that can result in significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and decrease in quality of life. anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. evidence found in the literature demonstrates that the vaccine prevents shingles in approximately half of adults 60 and older. immunization can be divided into passive, which is by giving certain type of antibody and active, which means that either we get the disease, or we get the antigen injected into our body.having prior vaccination or past covid-19 does not mean that someone is totally immune to covid-19 as a recent study suggested that the antibody related to covid-19 past infection is significantly decreasing after 3 months post-infection. shingles is a painful rash caused by the varicella zoster virus (1). persons of all ages are at risk for shingles. vaccines have been developed to prevent shingles, and beginning in 2017, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) recommended that all adults aged 50 and over be vaccinated (3). the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) outbreak has created a huge demand for rapid and high-volume vaccine manufacturing. 
   The cytokines released in severe COVID can cross the BBB & cause inflammation. The “happy hypoxia” has neuro implications. The cytokine storm can also cause clots. Again, the mechanism of cell entry is identical to SARS 1. And I can’t find any info that SARS 1 did this. [SEP] severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) is identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and is often linked to extreme inflammatory responses by over activation of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets), cytokine storm, and sepsis. blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 infection. on the other hand, an exaggerated immune response to the sars-cov-2 invasion may lead to uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokine development of cytokine storm (cs). it has been shown that in patients who are severely ill, sars-cov-2 can lead to an inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, which involves activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in a positive feedback loop of pathogen-triggered inflammation. accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars -cov2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. keywords: covid-19; sars-cov2; cytokine storm; coagulopathy and anti-inflammatory. in sars-cov-2 infection, like other febrile illnesses, high blood viscosity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction-induced coagulation disorders may increase risk of hf development. in conclusion, sars-cov-2 infection may lead to the development of hf due to direct acute cardiac injury or through the development of cytokine storms, which depress cardiomyocyte function and cardiac contractility. sars-cov-2 causes severe respiratory syndrome (covid-19) with high mortality due to a direct cytotoxic viral effect and a severe systemic inflammation. sars-cov-2 causes a delay in the innate immune response and it disarranges the immune system leading to an overwhelming inflammatory reaction (the 'cytokine storm'). 
 Same with me and my siblings, but in our case it's long term illnesseses that cause compromised immune systems, in fact my brother is on immune suppressants due to a rare auto immune disease, so for us the risks of COVID are far worse than potential side effects of the vaccine. [SEP] common covid-19 vaccines side effects are pain at the injection site, muscle pain, fever, headaches, fatigue. immune-mediated side effects remain a rare event, thus the benefits of covid-19 vaccines outweigh the risk of disease flares and we strongly recommend it in all eligible patients with aa. vaccination can prevent infection and disease due to sars-cov-2. patients with autoimmune disorders are at risk for severe covid-19, and are frequently immune suppressed related to therapy, the underlying disease, or both. novel mrna and vector-based covid-19 vaccinations have shown high efficacy in preventing symptomatic covid-19 infections. vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect that has only been observed in adenovirus-based vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). more subtly, phylodynamic models indicate that widespread cross-protective immunization could slow the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza; these effects have profound implications for a transition to mass vaccination strategies against human influenza, and for the management of antigenically variable viruses in general. due to its leading role in fighting infections, the human immune system has been the focus of many studies in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the aim of this review is to explain what happens to the immune system after recovery from covid-19 and/or vaccination against sars-cov-2, the virus that causes the disease. further, we explain the reason why immunity after covid-19 infection plus a vaccination appears to induce a stronger response compared with virus exposure alone. 
   A mortality rate under 1% from a vaccine is still a stunning success. Of course people may die from it, but those cases are far and few between and a much lesser toll than untreated covid will cause. The scales aren’t even close to equal. [SEP] compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. over 50 million people have been infected with the sars-cov-2 virus, while around 1 million have died due to covid-19 disease progression. even if effective and safe vaccines are found, pharmacological interventions are still needed to limit disease severity and mortality. with recent covid-19 vaccination rates relatively high in the usa, the usa still maintains the most documented cases globally,[1] even though covid-19 cases, hospitalization, and mortality have been declining. of these children, an estimated 5.3 million died of all causes in 2018, with an estimated 700,000 who died of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases; 99% of the children who died had lived in low- and middle-income countries. the infectious diseases that remain major causes of mortality for which vaccines have been shown to provide proven preventive success include, in order of prevalence, are those caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, bordetella pertussis, measles virus, haemophilus influenzae type b and influenza virus. objective: the purpose of the present report was to address the global burden of these six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children < 5 years of age, together with implications for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection in children. conclusion: issues with regard to the burden of disease mortality, disease transmission, and available vaccines as well as vaccine successes and shortcomings for specific pathogens can serve as important landmarks for effective use of future vaccines. it is found that the higher the rate of pneumococcal vaccination in a nation (or city) the lower the covid-19 morbidity and mortality. as of april 13, 1,773,084 people were infected and 111,652 people had died from covid-19 globally, and new record levels of infection are being reported every day. 
 Thanks for linking this and telling some of your story. 💜 I've dealt with chronic illness most of my adult life. My biggest worry about COVID-19, and not just for myself, is the long-term effects it's going to cause. Few people understand how drastically it can change your life. [SEP] to investigate and characterise general and diabetes-specific worries related to covid-19 among people with diabetes in denmark during the first 3 months of the pandemic. in the beginning of the pandemic, 2 weeks after the first lockdown in denmark, the most frequently reported general worries related to someone close becoming seriously ill, changes in daily life such as limitations on social interactions and uncertainty about the duration of those changes. the most frequently reported diabetes-specific worries were about severity of illness with covid-19 due to diabetes, being identified as a member of a group at risk for covid-19 and being unable to manage diabetes if ill with covid-19. our study highlights the diversity of worries related to the covid-19 pandemic among people with diabetes and changing patterns of worry over time and across subgroups as the society reopened in denmark. we investigated what people fear most in terms of disabling chronic diseases and their concerns regarding having long-term illnesses. while there were variations in the diseases feared most across sex, ethnicity, and place of residence, the biggest worry for all respondents with regard to having a long-term illness was that they would become a burden to their family, a concern that superseded fear of dying. our results highlight the covid-19 long-term impacts on individual mental health and call for the need for future research concerning the consequences for the population, especially among young adults. people at high risk of severe illness from covid-19 have experienced greater restrictions during the pandemic, yet there is a paucity of research exploring their lived experience. this study explored the impact of covid-19 on people identified as at high risk of severe illness by uk government, and in particular, the impact of the first lockdown on access to healthcare, medications and use of technological platforms. 1038 uk adults who identified as at high risk of severe illness from covid-19 in line with uk government guidance or self-identified with acute or other chronic health conditions, completed the awareness, attitudes and actions survey which explored the impact of covid-19 on access to healthcare, management of long-term health condition, mental health, and health behaviours. 
The virus seems to cause two kinds of lung disease + blood disease. Young people are having strokes. Young people who had light cases may be developing new syndromes of dangerous illness. #COVID is the Swiss army knife of viruses, can & will do anything to anybody. https://t.co/Nj7UA6jvma [SEP] covid-19 seems as global emergency, by infectious virus, caused respiratory illness like having symptoms of flue, sickness, headache, and difficulty in breathing. however, the collateral effects on the covid-19 pandemic appear to have had significant detrimental effects on children affected and young people. in this short communication, we review the collateral effects of covid-19 pandemic in children and young people. what is known: • children and young people account for <2% of all covid-19 hospital admissions • the collateral impact of covid-19 pandemic on children and young people is devastating • significant reduction in influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection in the southern hemisphere what is new: • the public health measures to reduce covid-19 infection may have also resulted in near elimination of influenza and rsv infections across the globe • a covid-19 vaccine has been licensed for adults. with the virus becoming more prevalent day by day, it is not just the elderly, but even young people are falling seriously ill. the virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after covid-19. in the clinic, covid-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus. in this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which has caused covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. 
 There are are over 1000 Covid cases in East Lansing.  The virus can cause cardiac inflammation. Anyone else think this is just a really stupid idea? [SEP] presymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), might pose challenges for disease control. coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect humans, which may result in mild symptoms similar to those of the common cold. covid-19 is a novel viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) beta-coronavirus. cardiac manifestations of covid-19 are focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmia. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has quickly progressed to a global health emergency. patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of covid-19. there is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in sars-cov-2. myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of covid-19. myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst covid-19 patients. 
    No, with a virus that causes heart, lung, kidney & brain damage, strokes & heart failure are known to be caused by #COVID19.  It’s also expected to cause more cases of dementia long term. Now go get a vaccine! https://t.co/Egd4G45E0Q [SEP] covid-19 (corona virus disease-2019) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, known as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). this review aims to highlight the pertinent documentary evidence upon the adverse effects of the sars-cov-2 infection on several vital human organs. sars-cov-2 primarily targets the lung tissue by causing diffuse alveolar damage and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). besides lungs, sars-cov-2 critically damage tissues in other vital human organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality with a prevalence of 1%-2% of the adult population. however, the prognostic impact of depression and the role of heart failure as a risk factor for dementia and stroke are not fully understood. finally, we studied the association between heart failure and subsequent short-term and long-term risks of dementia (study iv) and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (study v). the heart failure cohort had a 21% increased rate of all-cause dementia, mainly driven by increased hazards of vascular dementia and other dementia, whereas heart failure was not associated with alzheimer's disease. finally, heart failure emerged as a risk factor for all-cause dementia as well as for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. the most frequent and most well-known cardiac cause of neurological complications is cardiac embolism. 
 They are both are Coronaviruses that are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections. Rarer forms such as SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus causing the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak can be lethal. [SEP] we will also discuss the outbreaks of the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), which are relevant for understanding covid-19. the two coronavirus species, middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus are lethal to human. severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) are lethal species caused by human coronaviruses (hcovs). three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as the cause of large-scale epidemics over the last two decades: middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (sads). we also discuss the outbreaks of the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the recently identified middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). coronaviruses are a group of envelop viruses which lead to diseases in birds and mammals as well as human. besides, sars-cov, mers-cov, and newly identified sars-cov-2, which is also known as 2019-ncov, are the more dangerous viruses. similar to other coronaviruses like the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) cov, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. the infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which occurred in 2002, and the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). 
    If you get vaccinated you can fight of infection as if you get normal cold. As your immune already knows the threat the effect of virus will be mild. In case you dont get vaccine..your immune takes time to identify virus(covid turns to pneumonia fast) which may cause serious prob [SEP] however, little is known about what americans think of getting immunized with a covid-19 vaccine. an effective vaccine against covid-19 is a desired solution to curb the spread of the disease. however, vaccine hesitancy might hinder high uptake rates and thus undermine efforts to eliminate covid-19 once an effective vaccine became available. in study 1 (n = 310), the intention to get vaccinated against covid-19 was correlated with knowledge about and belief in herd immunity through vaccination (r = .58, p < .001), as well as with empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (r = .26, p < .001). the motivation to get vaccinated against covid-19 was related to and could be causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity through vaccination and by empathy. while vaccines ensure individual protection against covid-19 infection, delay in receipt or refusal of vaccines will have both individual and community impacts. hence, it is of high importance for public health officials to know whether people are going to get vaccinated for covid-19. higher knowledge score regarding symptoms, transmission routes and prevention and control measures against covid-19 was significantly associated with higher willingness of respondents to get vaccinated. "), attitudes toward vaccines in general and specific to sars-cov2 using the vaccination attitudes examination scale, and incentives for getting vaccinated for those who reported they would not get vaccinated. several vaccines against covid-19 have now been developed and are already being rolled out around the world. 
 Covid19 contains 4 spike proteins found in hiv. The cause of Covid 19 is from the twins that were genetically altered to be immune to hiv.  They contracted a coronavirus that exploited their resistance to hiv, and mutated to covid19 [SEP] sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) was first detected in china in late 2019 and has since then caused a global pandemic. here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of sars-cov-2. coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) is a pandemic respiratory infection caused by a new betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection. covid19 is the third most aggressive coronavirus that spreads rapidly and kills many people. in addition to these elements, genetic factors have an important role in covid19 infection. the present review gives a brief overview of different genes involved in the infection by sars-cov-2 and its association with disease severity. the results of our research showed that many different genes are associated with a higher risk for covid-19, notably those coding for proteins involved in coronavirus-cell entry and fusion such as ace2 (angiotensin i converting enzyme 2), tmprss2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) and cd26. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes covid-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with hiv. understanding the pathogenesis of covid-19 could potentially aid in developing effective treatment strategies for covid-19 in hiv associated preeclampsia. 
Peripheral neuropathy hurts, I know firsthand via a motor-sensory stroke.  The CoVID vaccine DOES cause the fingers to ache -- my weakest finger aches now; it was the thumb a week ago.  But it's NOTHING like the CPSP pain, at all!   It's a sore pain (how I notice the difference). [SEP] there was a statistically significant difference in the intensity of the words pain, ache and hurt on both the vas and the mpq. central post-stroke pain (cpsp) is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by constant or intermittent pain in a body part occurring after stroke and associated with sensory abnormalities in the painful body part. this study describes cpsp prospectively during the first year after stroke and characterizes the cerebrovascular lesions and neurological signs associated with the cpsp syndrome. the pain quality was usually lacerating or aching. the authors used mri and quantitative somatosensory testing in 73 patients with central poststroke pain (cpsp) and in 13 patients with pain-free stroke with sensory deficit. most cpsp patients have multiple lesions, many probably unrelated to pain. supratentorial cpsp patients have a deficit of sharpness and cold (peripherally mediated by a delta fibers) than pain-free stroke patients, whereas patients with infratentorial cpsp additionally have a deficit of c-fiber-mediated warmth and hot pain. warmth and cold, but not hot pain, exhibiting central convergence (spatial summation) are more affected in cpsp patients with burning than nonburning pain. the progression from painless sensory deficit to cpsp is not purely quantitative. the carpal tunnel syndrome, or compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist, is a common cause of burning pain, numbness and tingling in the hand. 
Fighting stigma —  COVID-19 'brain fog' inspires search for causes and treatments: Spudich leads a study using brain imaging along with analyses of spinal ... off Alzheimer's disease and other conditions without adequate evidence. https://t.co/CXW5PMcTav [SEP] she also noted the presence of "brain fog," as if lacking the same clarity that she had prior to her illness. cognitive symptoms after covid-19 have been increasingly recognized several months after the acute infection and have been designated as "brain fog." we report a patient with cognitive symptoms that started immediately after covid-19, in which cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were highly suggestive of alzheimer's disease. we investigated the frequency of brain fog in a large cohort of patients with documented coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) who have survived the illness. in this large population-based study, we report that chronic post-covid "brain fog" has significant associations with sex (female), respiratory symptoms at the onset, and the severity of the illness (icu admission). covid-19 has a serious impact on the patient brain. covid-19 is increasingly being linked to brain health impacts. the emerging situation is consistent with evidence of immunological injury to the brain, which has been described as a resulting "brain fog." alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and represents the main cause of dementia. these results warrant monitoring alzheimer's disease patients with covid-19 carefully for the possible higher viral load in the brain and long-term adverse neurological consequences. 
             Misunderstanding of nicotine is profoundly bad.  A recent Rutgers U. study found 80% of US doctors think it causes cancer.  It does not.  Nicotine MAY reduce #COVID19 risks; DEFINITELY reduces Parkinson's disease risk 30-60%; MAY reduce Alzheimer's; DEFINITELY reduces weight... [SEP] smoking is an inverse risk factor for parkinson's disease, although the mechanism for this apparent neuroprotection is not definitively established. smoking consistently upregulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor levels in various brain regions known to be involved in parkinson's disease. specifically, this paper considers the hypothesis that smoking reduces the risk of parkinson's disease through the upregulation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in key brain regions involved in parkinson's disease. this hypothesis is supported by evidence documenting the upregulation of nicotinic receptors in the brains of smokers, neuroprotective effects of nicotine, reduced activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome in parkinson's disease, and increased activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in animals exposed to chronic nicotine. accumulating evidence suggests that nicotine, a drug that stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, may be of therapeutic value in parkinson's disease. this reduced incidence of parkinson's disease has been attributed to the nicotine in tobacco products, at least in part, based on experimental work showing a protective effect of nicotine against toxic insults. second, several studies suggest a symptomatic effect of nicotine in parkinson's disease, although effects are small and somewhat variable. accumulating evidence suggests that drugs such as nicotine that act at these sites may be of benefit for parkinson's disease treatment. experimental work in parkinsonian animal models suggests that nicotine in tobacco may contribute to this protection. these combined findings suggest that nicotine and nachr drugs offer the possibility of improved therapeutics for parkinson's disease. 
 The FDA has known for months that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can cause the same problem. Why haven’t they paused those, too?  https://t.co/yKMxNHjjVo [SEP] many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. this article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines. the occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the pfizer/biontech vaccine compared to the moderna vaccine; however, the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the pfizer/biontech vaccine compared to the moderna covid-19 vaccine; however, the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. ve against covid-19 hospitalizations was higher for the moderna vaccine (93%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 91%-95%) than for the pfizer-biontech vaccine (88%; 95% ci = 85%-91%) (p = 0.011); ve for both mrna vaccines was higher than that for the janssen vaccine (71%; 95% ci = 56%-81%) (all p<0.001). both pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines are mrna vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. in december 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued emergency use authorizations (euas) for pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines, and in february 2021, fda issued an eua for the janssen (johnson & johnson) covid-19 vaccine. we queried the fda vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) for all reported symptoms following the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines as of february 12th, 2021. the pfizer-biontech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. in december 2020, the fda approved the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for use in preventing covid-19 in the united states. 
  Steady on.  Covid (particularly the new strain) does cause pneumonia... [SEP] outbreak pneumonia announced in wuhan, china, in december 2019, had its causative factor classified as a new coronavirus (sars-cov-2). this virus causes respiratory disease (for instance, flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and, in severe cases, pneumonia. the second one to discern between covid-19 and pneumonia. the new disease outbreak that causes atypical pneumonia named covid-19, which started in china's wuhan province, has quickly spread to a pandemic. covid-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). severe respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia not responding to non-invasive respiratory support requires mechanical ventilation. the pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection can lead to a pattern of lung injury in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia typically associated with two distinct phenotypes, along a temporal and pathophysiological continuum, characterized by different levels of elastance, ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, right-to-left shunt, lung weight and recruitability. over the last two decades, the cov has periodically emerged in the general population, causing a varying degree of pneumonia. similar to its predecessors, covid-19 causes a fatal form of pneumonia; however, in a small percentage of patients, covid-19 has shown to cause neurological symptoms. bacterial pneumonia isn't what it used to be. 
   So basically we never have to wear sunblock again because UV rays kill the virus. Of course those same rays can cause skin cancer, but at least no Corona right? SMH Don't forget to drink some bleach tonight.  gets my vote [SEP] to reduce exposures to the sun's harmful ultraviolet (uv) rays, the american academy of dermatology (aad), the american cancer society, and other organizations have recommended sun-protection practices such as wearing protective clothing, avoiding sun exposure during the midday hours (when the sun's rays are the strongest), and using sunscreen. demographics coupled with inconsistent and low levels of sunblock use, high annual prevalence of indoor tanning, and multiple lifetime sunburns indicate that this sample is at high risk for skin cancer. defense strategies to protect from uv rays have been extensively studied, as sunburn, photoaging, and photocarcinogenesis are caused by excessive uv exposure. although the sun is very beneficial and essential for life, exposing ourselves too much to sunlight might lead to detrimental health effects such as skin cancer. hence, the use of sunscreen is strongly encouraged by many healthcare practitioners in order to minimize or possibly eradicate the harmful effects of uv rays on our skin, keeping in mind, that about 90% of all skin cancers are associated with exposure to the sun's harmful radiation. in addition, at present, sunscreens are very useful in preventing sunburn and probably skin cancer and photoaging and their regular use can have a positive and a significant impact on public health as means or instruments implemented to reduce exposure to uv radiation. during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, the use of ultraviolet (uv) rays to disinfect skin areas, clothes and other objects at the entry/exit points of public spaces has been widely discussed by stakeholders. while ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (uvgi) has been shown to effectively inactivate coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov)-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), no specific evidence proves that it effectively inactivates the new sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19. ultraviolet rays can have both harmful and beneficial effects. there is a need to prevent the harmful effects and harness the useful effects of uv radiations. 
Diet, exercise, and other interventions, you can radically reduce your risk of COVID-19. The focus of my COVID-19 prevention method is on strengthening immune function through stress and anxiety reduction. Chronic stress cause inflammation which has a profound impact on diseases [SEP] it has been shown that a careful diet rich in antioxidants, regular exercise, and fasting regimens, each and/or together, can reduce the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress and strengthen the immune system as they lead to weight loss and activate cellular antioxidant mechanisms and reduce oxidative damage. thus, a lifestyle change based on the three pillars: antioxidants, exercise, and fasting could act as a proactive preventative measure against the adverse effects of covid-19 by maintaining redox balance and well-functioning immunity. the covid-19 pandemic has become a major cause of stress and anxiety worldwide. we explore lifestyle interventions that have specifically been demonstrated to strengthen host defense, reduce the probability and mitigate the severity of viral infection. therefore, this review is aimed at exploring the role of physical exercise training in the face of covid-19 in older adults and elderly individuals. from this point of view, this review suggests that physical exercise training plays a key role in promoting immune system regulation, delaying immunity dysfunction, reducing circulatory inflammation markers, and preventing sarcopenia and thus could prevent the risk of acquiring covid-19 infection and reduce the complications of recommended self-isolation in older adults and elderly individuals. finally, in accordance with recommendations to stay home and perform self-isolation to prevent the spread of covid-19, all populations are strongly recommended to practice regular home exercise training at home to promote immune system functioning. the covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health and well-being worldwide and there is increasing recognition of the need to understand the psychological impact of covid-19 experiences and stress in addition to the physical health consequences. strengthening the immune system in order to better withstand the threat of covid-19 is an important way to ensure the protection of our health against the current pandemic associated with sars-cov-2. here we review the effects that particular immuno-strengthening activities can have on limiting the severity of covid-19 disease as well as preventing virus infection. 
 It's just so ignorant and stupid to insist the covid-19 vaccine will cause people to be  magnetic.  It's just so ridiculous It's pitiful. [SEP] understanding people's attitudes towards covid-19 vaccination is crucial to the successful implementation of a vaccination program. in contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards covid-19 vaccinations. on the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up covid-19 vaccinations. participants' intentions to take up covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of covid-19 vaccines in cultivating covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'. during the covid-19 pandemic, different conspiracies have risen, with the most dangerous being those focusing on vaccines. today, there exists a social media movement focused on destroying the credibility of vaccines and trying to convince people to ignore the advice of governments and health organizations on vaccination. the analysis of anti-covid19 tweets showed that attacks against vaccine safety were the most important (79.87%) but we detected a new kind of message presenting the vaccine as a means of manipulating the human genetic code (8.1%). we observed a new topic in covid-19 vaccine hoaxes that must be considered in our fight against misinformation. vaccines can be regarded as one of the most powerful weapons to eliminate the pandemic, but the impact of vaccines on daily covid-19 cases and deaths by country is unclear. recent evidence suggests that influenza vaccination may offer protection against covid-19 severity. 
There’s no evidence that the new #vaccine against COVID-19 cause infertility, yet that’s a worry that’s been cited by some has a reason they’re reluctant to be first in line to get the shots. #covid #infertility https://t.co/NlB1y0WWWw [SEP] of women who were unlikely to get vaccinated, the most frequently cited concern was vaccine safety for their pregnancy (82%). although most pregnant women worried about covid-19 illness, <50% were willing to get vaccinated during pregnancy. · less than half of pregnant patients stated they would get a covid-19 vaccine.. · protecting their baby was the most common reason for acceptance and refusal of the covid-19 vaccine.. · patients of minority race/ethnicity and those without prior influenza vaccination were less likely to accept the covid-19 vaccine.. wolfgang wodarg and micheal yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the bnt162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) manufactured by biontech and pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. the european medicines agency and the us food and drug administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that covid-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. vaccine acceptance was also higher in persons with high risk perception (aor = 1.61, 95%ci:1.13-2.81, high vs. low), those who were unconcerned about vaccine safety (aor = 1.71, 95%ci:1.13-3.55), and those who were not worried about efficacy (aor = 2.02, 95%ci:1.14-4.11) and infertility-related rumors (aor = 1.98, 95%ci:1.24-3.18). lower perceived susceptibility to covid-19, belief that data on the efficacy of vaccines is 'largely made up', having lower confidence in government, and lower perception of covid-19 as a public health threat, were also associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against covid-19. the most prevalent reasons against covid-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. however, intention to get vaccinated for covid-19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support. vaccination hesitancy is a major looming problem for covid-19. 
     a person who had high blood pressure or diabetes out it is still the Covid19 that killed them. They would be contributing caused not the primary one.[NEWLINE]And yes, if a person had  Covid but  had a diabetic coma and died you would likely say that the diabetic coma was the primary [SEP] ten subjects who died in a diabetic coma, eight diabetics who died of known causes unrelated to diabetes, and seven normal control subjects without any diagnosed diabetes who died of known causes. diabetic coma was highly associated with abnormalities in the biochemical variables. the risk of dying at onset was very high; diabetic children in coma (4.7%) were 12 times more likely to die than patients without coma. consideration of the enormously high rates of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in persons with diabetes and renal disease is the primary factor in choosing agents for blood pressure reduction. most deaths occurred in patients with long-standing diabetes. for persons suffering from diabetic disorder, the covid-19 infection becomes a dual challenge. normally, communicable disease like covid-19 is more prevailing in patients with diabetes. all these conclusions clear out the intention that the diabetic patients are more susceptible to enhanced inflammatory response that may lead to rapid spreading of covid-19 infection with high rate of mortality. in the present situation of pandemic, managing diabetes seems to be quite challenging and diabetic patient having covid-19 infection should follow normal course of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs prescribed with the exception of sodium glucose co-transpoters-2 inhibitors which would increase the risk of dehydration and ketoacidosis. in view of above discussion, this article highlights the proposed mechanism of covid-19 infection linking it with diabetes, antidiabetic drugs to be used in covid-19 infection along with their advantages, and disadvantages and management of covid-19 infection diabetic patient. 
   No.  The Mrna vaccines don't use the live virus that causes covid-19.  The astrazeneca vaccine uses an adenovirus as a delivery system.  This  "vector" virus does not cause covid - 19. [SEP] the approved formulations of astrazeneca, jnj, and gam-covid-vac (sputnik v) contain dna delivered within non-replicating recombinant adenovirus vector-based systems, while the pfizer and moderna vaccines utilize mrna technology and lipid nanoparticle delivery systems. sars-cov-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mrna-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. since the outbreak of covid-19 in december, 2019, scientists worldwide have been committed to developing covid-19 vaccines. self-amplifying rna virus vectors have been utilized for lipid nanoparticle-based delivery of rna as covid-19 vaccines. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a newly emerged coronavirus, and has been pandemic since march 2020 and led to many fatalities. patients allergic to peg, previously denied covid vaccination, may now be safely vaccinated with the ps80 containing astrazeneca vaccine and need only avoid the peg-containing mrna covid-19 vaccines. in august 2021, fda amended the euas for the two mrna covid-19 vaccines to allow for an additional primary dose in certain immunocompromised recipients of an initial mrna covid-19 vaccination series (1). in an effort to control the covid-19 pandemic, large-scale vaccination is being implemented in various countries using anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines based on mrnas, adenovirus vectors, and inactivated viruses. coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (rna) viruses. novel mrna and vector-based covid-19 vaccinations have shown high efficacy in preventing symptomatic covid-19 infections. 
DO NOT RECEIVE SATAN'S VACCINES[NEWLINE]VACCINES FORBIDDEN by THE CREATOR[NEWLINE]VACCINES do NOT PREVENT Covid19 infection or transmission of the virus.[NEWLINE]VACCINES cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects. [NEWLINE]VACCINES contain harmful ingredients. [NEWLINE]VACCINES MADE FOR PROFIT not MEDICAL REASONS https://t.co/qTFslcm7MY [SEP] however, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (vacv) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. however, use of the classical live vacv vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., hiv-infected patients). among unvaccinated medical residents, 71% indicated concern about vaccine-related side effects, including potential but unknown reactions (58%) and possible transmission of aids (37%) and hepatitis (16%). vaccination is a cornerstone of global public health. although licensed vaccines are generally extremely safe, both experimental and licensed vaccines are sometimes associated with rare serious adverse events. vaccine-enhanced disease (ved) is a type of adverse event in which disease severity is increased when a person who has received the vaccine is later infected with the relevant pathogen. although rare, ved has important ethical implications because it can cause serious harm, including death, and such harms can undermine vaccine confidence more generally - leading to larger public health problems. we conclude this paper by summarising approaches to the reduction of risks and uncertainties related to ved, and the promotion of public trust in vaccines. parents should be aware of the potential serious side effects of the vaccine. self-reported barriers to uptake of the hendra virus vaccine by horse owners (n = 150) included concerns about vaccine safety, cost, and effectiveness. 
There is something I don't get - why does an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer's cause breathing problems?  Those with COVID-19 have such problems presumably because the virus is attacking the lungs. But the mRNA vaccines don't contain any viruses. [SEP] both pfizer and moderna vaccines are mrna-based vaccines, and are estimated to have an efficacy rate of more than 94%. using the mrna technology, the pfizer/biontech vaccine is one of the vaccines been approved by the drug control authority in malaysia. two novel vaccine platforms, based on mrna technology, were developed in 2020 by pfizer-biontech and moderna therapeutics (comirnaty® and spikevax®, respectively), and were the first ones presenting efficacies higher than 90%. this striking difference in efficacy could be attributed to the presence of a critical rna modification (n1-methyl-pseudouridine) in the pfizer-biontech and moderna's mrna vaccines (but not in cvncov). both pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines are mrna vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. a brief overview of covid-19 mrna vaccines is provided, describing the sars-cov-2 rna, how mrna vaccines work and the advantages of mrna over other vaccine platforms. the pfizer-biontech collaboration journey to short-list mrna vaccine candidates and finally selecting bnt162b2 based on safety data is outlined, followed by the phase 3 study of bnt162b2 demonstrating 95% efficacy in preventing covid-19 infections. nanoparticles are used not only in vaccine delivery, such as lipid nanoparticles mediated transport of mrna-based pfizer and moderna vaccines, but also in the development of vaccine as the virus-like particles elicit an immune response. cutaneous reactions after messenger rna (mrna)-based covid-19 vaccines have been reported but are not well characterized. we report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mrna covid-19 vaccines. 
 Typical example where covid19 is not a flu threat, but rather attacks the brain and causes major brain dysfunction. [SEP] although presence of virus in the human brain has not yet been reported in deceased patients, these avian influenza subtypes have the propensity to invade the brain along cranial nerves to target brainstem and diencephalic nuclei following intranasal instillation in mice and ferrets. the associations between influenza and psychiatric disturbances in past epidemics are here commented upon, and the potentials of influenza to cause nervous system dysfunction in experimental infections with a mouse-neuroadapted wsn/33 strain of the virus are reviewed. the migraine attack is a reversible brain dysfunction characterized by pain autonomic symptoms and passive coping strategies consistent with sickness behavior. the migraine attack may be interpreted as an example of genetically determined adaptive behavioral response to internal or external stressors that it is orchestrated by a threatened brain. flu was 10- to 27-fold higher in brain regions than in plasma. flu-so was the major metabolite in brain regions (24% to 96% of flu) and accumulated in fat 43 to 75 times more than flu. the covid19 pandemic has impacted the lives and health of persons worldwide and although majority of covid19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, pain emerges as an important feature of covid19 infection. cognitive, physical and psychological dysfunction reported by covid19 patients after discharge can have profound effects on quality of life. pain is usually part of this dysfunction, but it is still poorly understood how it affects survivors of covid19 infections. the purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the implications of covid19 on acute and chronic pain states. 
   If the vaccine hasn't been around that long, how do they know it can cause Alzheimer's. It doesn't suddenly come in a rush! 🤦‍♀️ I do know people who've had Covid - they had a worse reaction to the AZ vaccine but only 24-48 hours. Covid symptoms were awful and more than a month. [SEP] we do not know if recovery from covid-19 produces immunity, and if so for how long, hence we do not know if "herd immunity" will eventually reduce the risk or if a successful vaccine can be developed - and this knowledge may be a long time coming. although individuals are advised to take the vaccine to protect themselves and the people around them from covid-19 infection, many are doubtful about the consequences of the vaccine. so, this study assessed the immediate symptoms associated with taking the oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine. most of them (60%) developed their injection site symptom within 12 hours after vaccination and the symptoms lasted for about 24-72 hours on most (63.53%) of the participants. as like that of other vaccines, the oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine has some adverse effects and most side effects peaked within the first 24 hours following vaccination and usually lasted 1-3 days. after receiving the covid-19 vaccination, recipients should be advised about potential vaccine symptoms, how to handle them, and when and where to seek additional guidance if necessary. respondents aged > 65 years old, those who either themselves or a member of their household belonged to a vulnerable group, those believing that the covid-19 virus was not developed in laboratories by humans, those believing that coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal compared to the h1n1 virus, and those believing that next waves are coming were statistically significantly more likely to be willing to get a covid-19 vaccine. the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) advises people with a previous history of any immediate allergic reaction to remain under observation for approximately 30 minutes after covid-19 vaccination. to date, vaccines that prevent sars-cov-2 infection have not raised major concerns of severe allergic reactions, although, in some cases, pain and redness at the injection site and fever have occurred after administration of the vaccine. these reactions occur in the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. 
    As far as being run over by a truck, yes it is possible that someone trying to beat a truck when crossing a road collapses and gets struck down.  Cause lungs collapsed from damage caused by Covid, totally possible. Cardiac  arrest is one of many symptoms of covid. [SEP] for workers on foot and maintenance workers, being struck by heavy equipment or trucks (especially while backing up for workers on foot), and being struck by equipment loads or parts were the major causes of death. fatigue driving is a leading cause of traffic fatalities and injuries in china, especially among heavy truck drivers. moreover, it is found that (a) in jiangxi, an employed truck driver has a higher risk of crash involving multi-vehicles or a passenger car at bridge locations, and (b) in shaanxi, the adult, tunnel location, summer and winter days prohibit statistically significant association with the occurrence of multi-vehicle and single-vehicle run-off-road/rollover crashes. a 49-year-old male pedestrian was fatally injured when an overloaded truck backed over him and two of the truck's rear wheels rolled over his chest. the analysis suggests that loading by either the case weight or the maximum-permitted weight of the vehicle would have caused very severe compressions of the chest, likely resulting in multiple rib fractures, collapse of the ribcage and injury to the thoracic organs. thus, this analysis suggests that severe, possibly life-threatening, thoracic injury would have occurred if the vehicle was loaded to its maximum-permitted weight. some factors associated with lack of driver awareness, geometric improvements to roads or intersections, and the desire to achieve higher salaries by making more runs in a day were found to have a significant effect on causing severe injuries in gravel truck accidents. u.s. long-haul truck drivers traverse great distances and interact with numerous individuals, rendering them vulnerable to acquiring and transmitting coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). together, the unique co-occurrence of pronounced health disparities and known covid-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality risks suggest the possibility of a novel covid-19 based truck driver syndemic due to advanced driver age and endemic health issues. long-distance truck drivers have been identified as a high-risk group for coronavirus disease (covid-19) infection. 
 Precisely. It’s what I’ve said. Me being a young adult COVID does not affect me that much. A common flu is more severe for me, this vaccine we don’t know the long term health risks. The first vaccine caused blood clots, Who know what else these new one can cause [SEP] reported willingness to take the covid-19 vaccine is high among adults with id in the united kingdom, with factors associated with willingness having clear implications for public health policy and practice. the covid-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of clinical trials for finding a safe and effective vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes covid-19. although communication about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy were challenges long before covid-19, the twin facts of a pandemic and an "infodemic" of health information, misinformation, and disinformation have raised new challenges for vaccine-related communication and decision-making. the goal of this commentary is to highlight strategies to improve communication and decision-making for adults considering participation in covid-19 vaccine clinical trials. exposure rate negatively predicted flu vaccine uptake among adults. a positive attitude towards covid-19 vaccination was associated with being older, being a physician, being vaccinated against seasonal flu, and with several hbm factors (including perceived benefits and cues to actions). among hesitant staff, concerns about potential side effects and the impression that the vaccine was developed too quickly were the main reasons against covid-19 vaccination. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), is still an enormous threat to global health and the economy. meanwhile, considering the high mortality rate and rapid spread of the disease, a safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the pandemic. looking at gene variations in people infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and studying how genes influence people's response to infection will help to develop a vaccine that will help strengthen the immune system. 
  ...so a vaccine trialed in a study from the early 2000s can cause a liver inflammatory response in ferrets. But so can Covid-19, along with inflammation of most major organ systems. [SEP] improving covid-19 intervention strategies partly relies on animal models to study sars-cov-2 disease and immunity. in our pursuit to establish a model for severe covid-19, we inoculated young and adult male ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with sars-cov-2. intranasal inoculation established an infection in all ferrets, with viral dissemination into the brain and gut. despite this, a persistent inflammation in the nasal turbinates was prominent in especially young ferrets and follicular hyperplasia in the bronchi developed 21 days post infection. we conclude that intranasally-infected ferrets resemble asymptomatic covid-19 and possibly aspects of long-covid. combined with the increasing portfolio to measure adaptive immunity, ferrets are a relevant model for sars-cov-2 vaccine research. this case report discusses type i hypersensitivity in ferrets following exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) inoculum, observed during a study investigating the efficacy of candidate covid-19 vaccines. upon intranasal exposure to sars-cov-2 virus cultured in medium containing fbs, an allergic airway response occurred in 6 out of 56 of the ferrets. the 6 impacted ferrets were randomly dispersed across study groups, including different covid-19 vaccine candidates, routes of vaccine candidate administration, and controls (placebo). this was further supported by in vivo studies demonstrating ferrets administered diluted fbs also presented clinical signs consistent with a hyperallergic response, while clinical signs were absent in ferrets that received a serum-free sars-cov-2 inoculum. 
      An interesting arcticle (German language, pls use a translator), why Ivermectin and in first step, an antibiotic, isn't the correct choice in case of a new infection, before the first symptoms occure, or just occured.[NEWLINE]https://t.co/OythDvIzBP[NEWLINE]Corona causes an endotheliitis. [SEP] for patients who are more ill, linezolid and vancomycin are alternatives, the latter being first-line treatment for children hospitalized with mrsa skin infections. for patients with scabies who do not benefit from topical treatment, oral ivermectin is recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention, although it is not approved by the fda for this purpose. erythromycin is a second-choice bacteriostatic antibiotic, becoming first choice for treating dental infections in patients allergic to penicillin. tetracyclines are, at best, third-choice agents for usual dental infections. however, they are useful for cases of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis requiring systemic antibiotic therapy when penicillin is precluded. vancomycin and streptomycin are used prophylactically for prevention of infective endocarditis in patients with prosthetic heart valves. nystatin remains a first-choice agent for treatment of oral candidal infections. chemotherapy of viral infections is difficult because of the timing of events of the disease process versus appearance of clinical symptoms and lack of effective agents with selective toxicity. the standard microfilaricidal drugs ivermectin and albendazole are used in mass drug administration programmes, with the aim of interrupting transmission, with a consequent reduction in the burden of infection and, in some situations, leading to regional elimination of lf and onchocerciasis. new antihelminthic drugs (such as ivermectin) seem promising and need to be evaluated in controlled studies. 
#COVID19 IS NOT A COLD Soooo If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, understand that this can happen: “#coronavirus could be acting like herpes, which causes cold sores & in rare cases, brain swelling AKA #encephalitis. That swelling triggers the immune system.“ https://t.co/dw3WQZCbmr [SEP] herpes simplex virus (hsv) causes significant morbidity on the human population through such clinical syndromes as cold sores, genital herpes, herpes stromal keratitis, and encephalitis. two of the most prevalent human viruses worldwide, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (hsv-1 and hsv-2, respectively), cause a variety of diseases, including cold sores, genital herpes, herpes stromal keratitis, meningitis and encephalitis. hsv-1 can cause serious diseases at every stage of life including fatal disseminated disease in newborns, cold sores, eye disease, and fatal encephalitis in adults. herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2 (hsv-1 and hsv-2) are amongst the most common human infectious viral pathogens capable of causing serious clinical diseases at every stage of life, from fatal disseminated disease in newborns to cold sores genital ulcerations and blinding eye disease. herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (hsv1 and hsv2) are global, widespread human pathogens transmitted by direct contact that cause lifelong, recurrent asymptomatic and painful symptomatic clinical illnesses (cold sores, keratitis, blepharitis, meningitis, encephalitis, genital infections), overt disease and severe sequelae in neonatal and immune-compromised patients, and increased risk of cervical cancer and other sexually transmitted infections, including hiv [...]. we observed a cluster of thigh swelling episodes in infants in which the cause was bacillus calmette-guérin-related cold thigh abscess. herpes simplex virus (hsv) is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted infection that aside from causing cold sores and genital lesions, causes complications in the immunocompromised and has facilitated a large proportion of hiv acquisition globally. immunization of cotton rats with a split hsv-1 vaccine protected animals against viral replication and brain pathology, suggesting that vaccination against hsv-1 may protect against demyelinating disorders.importance our work demonstrates for the first time a direct association between infection with herpes simplex virus 1, a ubiquitous human pathogen generally associated with facial cold sores, and multifocal brain demyelination in an otherwise normal host, the cotton rat sigmodon hispidus for a long time, demyelinating diseases were considered to be autoimmune in nature and were studied by indirect methods, such as immunizing animals with myelin components or feeding them toxic substances that induce demyelination. this work provides the first experimental evidence for the role of hsv-1 as the etiologic agent of multifocal brain demyelination in a normal host and suggests that vaccination against hsv-1 can help to combat demyelinating disorders. herpes simplex virus commonly causes 'cold sores', the virus often becoming latent after the primary infection and recrudescing at intervals. 
 An organization that doesn't use statistics to guide policy is inept. 6 vaccine injuries out of 7 million doses administered. One in a million odds. Versus what are the odds of injury from covid? Less than one in a million? An over abundance of caution can cause harm. [SEP] there was a significant positive correlation between the vaccine coverage (%) and new cases per one million populations (rho = 0.24; p-value = 0.025); however, this correlation was absent in deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.17; p-value = 0.124). on further analysis of the effect of first reported year of vaccination policy, there was no significant correlation with both of total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.11; p-value = 0.327) and deaths per one million populations (rho = -0.02; p-value = 0.829). this shows, india's current covid-19 vaccination policies and plans are still inadequate and not undisputedly equitable even after several amendments in the guidelines. by mid-2021 three billion doses of covid-19 vaccine have been administered around the world, mostly in high-income countries. adverse events of myocarditis and pericarditis following covid-19 vaccination were rare, with an incidence rate of 5.98 (95% ci = 5.73-6.24) cases per million doses administered. this study found increased risks for myocarditis/pericarditis following mrna covid-19 vaccines. we used a prioritisation algorithm to identify potential allocative efficiency gains from prioritising vaccine allocation among countries or administrative units to maximise cases or deaths averted. at 100% vaccine coverage, these impact estimates increase to 5.2 million cases (95% cri 3.5-8.2 million) and 27,000 deaths (95% cri 14,000-43,000), 3.9 million cases (95% cri 2.7-6.0 million) and 19,000 deaths (95% cri 10,000-30,000), and 10.0 million cases (95% cri 6.7-15.7 million) and 51,000 deaths (95% cri 25,000-82,000), respectively. under realistic vaccine coverage, if the vaccine is prioritised sub-nationally, 5.3 million cases (95% cri 3.5-8.2 million) and 24,000 deaths (95% cri 12,000-38,000) could be averted at a dose constraint of 30 million. we did not account for within-country variation in vaccine coverage, and the optimisation was based on a single outcome measure, therefore this study should be used to understand overall trends rather than guide country-specific allocation. 
   It looks like covid causes neurological damage hence the array of symptoms. So supplements like B12 and magnesium may help. Also histamine seems to be high in some long haulers so reducing this can have benefit, by avoiding high histamine foods [SEP] these data indicate the role of histamine in food and wine intolerance and that histamine-rich food causes a worsening of symptoms in patients suffering from chronic headaches. oral administration of high-dose vitamin b12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin b12 or take vitamin b12 supplements. what are the current recommendations to manage gerd in pediatric patients with cp?answer a variety of lifestyle modifications can be used to manage gerd in pediatric patients with cp, including raising the head of the patient's bed, reducing patient weight, limiting exposure to smoke, and avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, fatty foods, and chocolate. the primary pharmacologic treatments currently recommended are histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. the patients seemed to be adapted to high plasma histamine levels as the symptoms were not typically systemic in nature, but rather localized phenomena like oedema and pruritus in the extremities. the evidence supporting the role of histamine as the causative agent is compelling. in some cases, when diet is not enough to maintain an adequate magnesium status, magnesium supplementation may be of benefit and has been shown to be well tolerated. diamine oxidase supplementation offers another treatment option. this review explores current knowledge surrounding these issues and suggests treatment strategies such as supplementation. 
  Doesn't matter. Covid can cause existing comorbidities to worsen. Covid can also CAUSE comorbidities, such as pneumonia, heart attack, clotting, kidney disease, etc. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]https://t.co/v4dkIEeqXH [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov2 is associated with various comorbidities; cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, liver, lung diseases, and neurological ailments. cardiovascular disease (cvd) is the most common co-morbidity associated with covid-19 and the fatality rate in covid-19 patients with cvd is higher compared to other comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. preliminary data suggest that covid-19 may also cause or worsen cardiac injury in infected patients through multiple mechanisms such as 'cytokine storm', endotheliosis, thrombosis, lymphocytopenia etc. covid-19 carries a high risk of severe disease course, particularly in patients with comorbidities. cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes), chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as main co-morbidities associated with worsen the clinical outcomes including mortality (risk difference rd 0.12, 95 %-ci 0.05-0.19, p = 0.001), admission to icu (rd 0.10, 95 %-ci 0.04-0.16, p = 0.001) and severe infection (rd 0.05, 95 %-ci 0.01-0.09, p = 0.01) in covid-19 patients. the non-covid-19 pneumonia group showed a higher (24% vs. 17%), although not statistically significant in-hospital mortality rate; the average duration of hospitalization was longer for covid patients (30 vs. 9 days, p = .0001). non-covid patients had higher charlson comorbidity scores, reflecting a greater disease burden in this population.key messagesin march 2020, the covid-19 disease was declared a pandemic, with enormous consequences for the organization of health systems and in terms of human lives; this has caused the relocation of huge financial resources to departments dedicated to infected patients, at the expense of those suffering from other pathologies.few published reports have compared covid-19 and non-covid-19 pneumonia. although covid-19 is a viral disease, there might be an association between different comorbidities and the occurrence of the disease. according to recent studies, the development of acute kidney injury (aki) in severe cases of covid-19 infection significantly worsens the prognosis of these patients. various lung comorbidities increase the severity of covid-19 and associated mortality by amplifying ace2 expression. 
There are a number of things that can cause you to lose your sense of taste and smell, but with COVID-19, it has been a common side effect.   https://t.co/aTtdgb6xWf [SEP] evidence is emerging that taste and smell loss are common symptoms of covid-19 that may emerge and persist long after initial infection. in this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in covid-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. this study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with covid-19 infection. this article provides an overview of olfactory loss and the recent findings relating to covid-19. this should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during covid-19 pandemic, and further highlights the value of loss of sense of smell and taste as a marker of infection. background: smell and taste dysfunctions are common and have been reported as an early indicator of covid-19. conclusions: evidence suggests that smell or taste dysfunctions were common among children with covid-19. since the initial anecdotal reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) from china, a growing number of studies have reported on smell and/or taste dysfunction (std). analysis stratified by severity of std showed that more than half of covid-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. many patients with clinically diagnosed covid-19 report an affected sense of smell and taste. 
Yeadon has said he personally doesn’t oppose the use of all vaccines.   It’s impossible to measure the impact of Yeadon’s claim that COVID-19 vaccines could cause female infertility. Anecdotally, though, many women have bought into it. https://t.co/GhJp0v0zLX [SEP] wolfgang wodarg and micheal yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the bnt162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) manufactured by biontech and pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. the european medicines agency and the us food and drug administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that covid-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. in females of reproductive age, enthusiasm for receiving a covid-19 vaccine may be negatively affected by claims currently circulating widely on diverse social media platforms regarding the vaccines adversely affecting fertility and pregnancy. it is also imperative that the effects of covid-19 vaccine on reproductive health are clarified. herein, we discuss the existing scientific data supporting covid-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in people who are planning to conceive or who are pregnant or lactating and highlight the importance of covid-19 vaccination in females of reproductive age. the early development of a vaccine against covid-19 is an important issue that must take into consideration women's better immune response to the virus along with the technique of hormone regulation. conclusions: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has had a major impact on infertile couples. to explore: i) the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on pregnant women's access to, and attitudes towards, routine maternal vaccines and; ii) women's attitudes towards testing covid-19 vaccines on pregnant women and their personal willingness to take part in such a trial. women were wary of receiving a new covid-19 vaccine, with most perceiving it as riskier than covid-19 itself. the potential harmful side effects of a covid-19 vaccine was the main reason for vaccine hesitancy. 
 Remestemcel-L therapy heals vascular damage caused by covid ARDS & ther conditions like spinal, diabetic neuropathy reducing risk of amputations. It will treat heart tissue damage, graft v host. Bone stemcells are the future.Treatment is here! $msb $meso #mesoblast https://t.co/zaQH2hqLnW [SEP] ryoncil™ (remestemcel-l), a human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (msc) product, failed to show superiority over placebo in patients with steroid-refractory acute gvhd, but it was approved for use in pediatric patients in canada and new zealand based on the results of a subgroup analysis. temcell®, an equivalent manufactured msc product to remestemcel-l, was approved in japan based on small single-arm studies by using a regulation for regenerative medicine in 2016. to determine whether exposure of bone marrow cells and subsequent grafting of epidermal sheets accelerates healing and reduces the need for amputation. despite conventional revascularization interventions including angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy and bypass grafts to vessels, a high incidence of amputation persists. the need to develop alternative therapeutic options is compelling; stem cell therapy aims to increase revascularization and alleviate limb ischemia or improve wound healing by stimulating new blood vessel formation, and brings new hope for the treatment of the diabetic foot. remestemcel-l, a third-party, off-the-shelf preparation of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs), has been developed for experimental use in acute graft-versus-host disease (agvhd) and other immune-mediated conditions. areas covered: this review critically examines the biologic rationale supporting mscs use in agvhd and analyzes the results of published clinical trials in this setting, with a particular focus on the potential benefits and drawbacks of remestemcel-l. for this purpose, a systematic literature search was performed in pubmed using the following keywords: 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'mesenchymal progenitor cells', 'multipotent stromal cells', 'mesenchymal cells', 'msc', 'remestemcel-l', 'prochymal', and 'graft-versus-host disease' or 'gvhd'. expert commentary: remestemcel-l represents a promising alternative to second-line immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of steroid-refractory agvhd. recent advances now offer these patients a regenerative process of restoring the wound with human integument by replacing damaged or missing tissue with similar tissue rather than scar formation. with the absence of complications and successful wound epithelialisation in a variety of diabetic wounds, regenerative tissue matrix products have taken the next step forward in wound healing. 
Some people I know who survived covid infection seem to be prediabetic now. This seems to be a side effect of the infection, perhaps caused by inflammatory damage to the pancreas. Treatment with corticosteroids may cause more damage through elevated blood glucose. [SEP] corticosteroids increase hepatic gluconeogenesis, reduce peripheral use of glucose and increase insulin levels. chronic or high-dose use of corticosteroids can, by itself, lead to the onset of diabetes. for those who were already diagnosed with diabetes, studies show that chronic use of corticosteroids leads to a 94% higher risk of hospitalization due to diabetes complications. in addition to the general damage of high glucose to cells and tissues, a recent discovery that high glucose activates interferon regulatory factor 15 promotes influenza virus -induced cytokine storm. this discovery may shed light on the high incidence of diabetes in covid-19. preexisting comorbidities are also linked to worse covid-19 outcome: studies suggest that diabetes and hypertension are linked to higher mortality rates. people with diabetes who contract covid-19 are likely to experience more serious symptoms than patients without diabetes. this article presents new research about the epidemiology of covid-19 in a group of patients with diabetes. it details the mortality and prognosis in such patients, as well as the relationship between covid-19 and the diseases most often coexisting with diabetes: obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and increased risk for infection. we also present a hypothesis related to the cause-and-effect axis-it turns out that diabetes can be both the cause of the more difficult course of covid-19 and the result of sars-cov-2 infection. 
Covid conundrum: vaccine known to cause headaches, sore arm, fatigue and nausea which are also symptom requiring testing. Must all vaccinated be tested? [SEP] incidence of local (sore arm) and systemic (headache, fever, muscle ache, nausea and diarrhea) side effects as well as serum titres of hemagglutination inhibition (hai) antibody to vaccine antigens before vaccination and 2 weeks and 6 months afterward. coronaviruses have evolved to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases, resulting in a wide range of diseases and symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle ache, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, and ageusia. this study examined associations among subjective side effects (soreness at the site of injection and illness-like symptoms), serum proinflammatory cytokines and body temperature a baseline, 1, 2, and 3 days following receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (iiv3) in a sample of 56 women 18-40 years in age. in relation to systemic reactions, women endorsing illness-like symptoms (headache, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, dizziness, achiness, or mild fever) exhibited marginally higher il-6 at baseline (p=0.055) and greater increases in serum mif at 2 days post-vaccination than those reporting no systemic symptoms. headache is the most common neurological symptom in over 50% of those vaccinated. the aim of the study is to examine in detail the clinical characteristics of headaches occurring after vaccination against covid-19 with the bnt162b2 mrna covid-19 vaccine for the first time. the primary outcomes of this study are the clinical features of headache after vaccination. a total of 2349 participants reported headaches after vaccination with the bnt162b2 mrna covid-19 vaccine. headaches occur an average of 18.0 ± 27.0 h after vaccination and last an average duration of 14.2 ± 21.3 h. only 9.7% of those affected also report headaches resulting from previous vaccinations. headaches after covid-19 vaccination show an extensive complex of symptoms. 
   Several. Heart attack or brain stroke most common cause. That apart, lot of vaccinated people also contracting Covid in some weeks. Several getting serious and some fatalities too. [SEP] compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. there were 5 people who got the placebo who died from covid-19. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) or covid-19 pandemic has taken away the lives of many people (>4 million per who) around the world as of july 2021. this report documents the first fatal case of rhabdomyolysis potentially associated with the covid-19 vaccine and supports the possibility that autoimmunity is a major risk factor for covid vaccine-related rhabdomyolysis. the coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) pandemic is one of the most devastating things that happened in the world which has taken the lives of millions of people and has brutally shattered the world economy. covid-19 has had a devastating impact and efforts are being made to speed up vaccinations. the growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of covid-19 vaccine. despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the covid-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. sars-cov-2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. with the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several associated health problems. 
Makes perfect sense considering that asthma is a chronic lung inflammation, and COVID19 causes severe acute lung inflammation (hence the name SARS-Cov2, of which SARS stands for Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome).. can't get a lung infection if you already have it chronically. [SEP] sars-cov2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) originating in wuhan china in 2019. sars-cov2 presents the ability to infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract as well as the intestinal tract. mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) and sars-cov-2 (cov2) are distinct organisms which both cause lung disease. inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of covid-19 related deaths. further, the severity of covid-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ace2, tmprss2, pai-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as sar-cov-2 infection. the importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and covid-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in il-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. select mirnas can regulate inflammation in covid-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. after inhalation, aerosols containing sars-cov-2 penetrate to the depths of the lungs and cause severe pneumonia, alveolar injury, and life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). 
Certainly not. We need much stricter #Idling laws to protect our #Children. #ToxicFumes cause #ChildAsthma stunt children’s #Lung and #Brain development and can cause life long #RespiratoryDisease. #ToxicAir also makes #coronavirus symptoms worse. Surely #ActiveTravel is needed https://t.co/InJAcViVDU https://t.co/rJ1puacgdF [SEP] neurologists need to protect children from unnecessary testing, ineffective and in some cases potentially dangerous exploitative treatments. current interventions provide some benefit, but new approaches to prevention and treatment grounded in a molecular understanding of stunting are needed. emeritus professor alan glasper, from the university of southampton, discusses what can be done to protect certain groups of children with long-term health conditions from catching sars-cov-2 disease caused by the novel coronavirus covid-19. furthermore, it is now being reported that a number of children appear to be reacting to the new coronavirus by developing a multisystem hyperinflammatory state with similar symptoms to that seen in toxic shock syndrome and which necessitates intensive care (campbell & sample, 2020). the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, has caused disruption in cancer care and research, changing daily management approach of cancer patients, above all for those affected by lung cancer disease. the lancet respiratory medicine 2020;27;s2213-2600(20) 30152-1). the current covid-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over. 
   Why can't you comprehend nuance? They can be encouraged about ImmunityBio's 2nd gen hAd5 vaccine, which does not cause HIV issues, among other benefits. That doesn't mean it's the primary reason for doing the trial in SA. https://t.co/D67cCv9mLf [SEP] why, it may be asked, would a person with hiv who is doing well on antiretroviral therapy be willing to jeopardise his health by enrolling in such a trial? this study sought to determine the level of general knowledge about hiv infection among finnish medical students and their willingness to participate in aids vaccine trials. fifty-four students (77%) from the 5th year and 66 (72%) from the 2nd year indicated their willingness to participate (wtp) in aids vaccine trials (p=0.09). recruitment, enrollment and retention of volunteers in an hiv vaccine trial is important in the efforts to ultimately develop a vaccine that can prevent new hiv infections. this article describes why individuals who were randomized in a phase i and ii hiv vaccine trial in dar es salaam, tanzania declined to be enrolled. fear of the negative outcome of an experimental vaccine and resistance from significant others are the main reasons for declining to enroll in the hiv vaccine trial among eligible volunteers after randomization. the "aids vaccine 2008" conference was held in cape town, south africa (october 13 to 16, 2008) and organized, under the aegis of the global hiv vaccine enterprise, by dr. lynn morris (chair of the conference) national institute of communicable diseases; dr. koleka mlisana from caprisa, university kwazulu-natal, durban, dr. glenda gray from perinatal hiv research unit, university witwatersrand, johannesburg and dr. carolyn williamson from institute of infectious diseses. this workshop was convened to evaluate these concerns regarding ade of hiv infection in human hiv vaccine trials and to propose studies that would address this potential risk. this study examined perceived risks, benefits, and desired information related to willingness to volunteer in preventive hiv vaccine trials. in this study, many benefits as well as risks of preventive hiv vaccine trial participation were cited. 
 AZ jabber here. I think there are 27m of us.. Am about to have 2nd one. My view is that Covid- or our immune response to Covid- can cause clotting in a very few unlucky folks. So you are still better off having the jab than Covid itself & at least we know what signs to look for [SEP] a longitudinal study compared levels of igg antibodies against the spike protein (s-rbd igg) (s-rdb protein igg) after one and two bnt162b2/pfizer jabs in residents with and without prior covid-19. in 735 residents without prior covid-19, 41.7% remained seronegative for s-rdb-protein igg after the first jab vs. 2.1% of the 270 rt-pcr-positive residents (p < 0.001). residents with a prior covid-19 infection had higher s-rdb-protein igg levels after one jab than those without after two jabs. a single vaccine jab is sufficient to reach a high humoral immune response in residents with prior covid-19. most residents without prior covid-19 are seropositive for s-rdb-protein igg after the second jab, but around 30% have low levels. whether residents with no or low post-vaccine s-rdb protein igg are at higher risk of symptomatic covid-19 requires further analysis. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has recently emerged, which was then spread rapidly in more than 190 countries worldwide so far. therefore, to better control patients with covid-19, it is recommended to consider a history of chronic inflammatory diseases as well as the way of controlling immune response in these patients. researchers still do not know definitively whether surviving a covid-19 infection means you gain long-lasting immunity and, if so, for how long? objectives this study looked at the rate of reporting at least one side effect post-covid-19 vaccination and its associated factors (sociodemographic characteristics, clinical condition, and type of vaccines). 
   Vaxed could have lowered immune systems for days after the vaccination that could cause more problems. There are prophylatics available. Does Haiti use Ivermectin as standard and few covid cases and Dominican republic I think gave care staff,  doctors something different. Better? [SEP] none was vaccinated adequately. one patient had received at least 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (opv). hopeful news reported the containment of an outbreak through the use of a vibrio cholera vaccine. the objective of this study was to explore knowledge and attitudes regarding vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases among caregivers and immunization providers in botswana, the dominican republic, and greece and examine how access to information impacts reported vaccine acceptance. in botswana, the dominican republic, and greece, participants expressed reliance on health care providers for information and demonstrated a need for more communication about vaccines. few patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have been reported in the dominican republic, although they share the island of hispaniola with haiti, which has numerous cases. prevalence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus in serum samples from dominicans tested from 1983 through 1985 was low in comparison with that of clinically healthy haitians working in the country. they emphasize that the extent of viral transmission in haiti is greater than that observed in the dominican republic. here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of covid-19. we surmise that this may be connected to ivermectin's ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. 
       COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. It’s not the Democrats providing the Covid-19 deaths it’s the CDC, Johns Hopkins and other healthcare professionals. [SEP] the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-ncov), which is currently known as sars-cov-2, is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) . the coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has spread across the world and is responsible for over 1,686,267 deaths worldwide. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel coronavirus that was first discovered in december 2019 in wuhan, china. like influenza viruses, sars-cov-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted by droplets and direct contact, and covid-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. covid-19 pandemic is caused by a novel virus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). we describe the three cases of influenza and covid-19 co-infection. the covid-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. the death toll of covid-19 is high even after its low mortality because covid-19 causes a pandemic while sars-cov and mers-cov cause epidemics only. covid-19, an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has emerged as global pandemic. 
  Corona viruses is a group of viruses , well known for many many years  ...which cause the common cold but the COVID 19 is a new one and more dangerous than a common cold (in my opinion produced in a lab) [SEP] the new coronavirus is spreading rapidly around the world these days, and many countries are heavily infected with it. corona is a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections, from the common cold to the sars epidemic that broke out in 2003, and now the newest member of the family (sars-cov-2) is present in iran. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is the name given by the world health organization (who) to the highly contagious and infectious disease caused by the novel corona virus or sars-cov-2, which was first reported on 31 december 2019 in wuhan city of the capital of china's hubei province. indeed covid-19 has turned out to be the most lethal of all coronaviruses as it has infected at least three million people killing more than two hundred thousands of them in the first 4 months of its spread. coronaviruses (cov) are rna viruses that cause endemic infections in various species of mammals and avian birds. some covs have recently entered humans from infected animals and lastly we have sars covid-19, (cov), which causes severe acute, often fatal respiratory syndromes. corona viruses are group of related rna viruses. coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in humans as well as in animals. coronaviruses are a group of envelop viruses which lead to diseases in birds and mammals as well as human. novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has spread throughout the world and has infected close to 4 million people. 
Hypothesis. If #LongCovid is caused by some ongoing reaction from the immune system (auto-inflammation, auto-immunity). Maybe Rituximab could help to ease down again the over-reacting immune system (B-cells)? [SEP] a large number of auto-immune diseases are treated with rituximab, an antibody against cd20 that depletes most of the b-cells in the organism. we describe the cellular and cytokinic components of the splenic plasma cell niche, notably cd4(+) t cells and discuss possible survival factors that could be targeted simultaneously with rituximab-mediated b-cell depletion to interfere with plasma cell persistence. evidence is presented to suggest that an auto-immune response to a liver-specific lipoprotein antigen on the surface of hepatocytes is responsible for the progressive liver damage in active chronic hepatitis, and that in many cases infection with the hepatitis b virus is important in the initiation of the disease process. rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the cd20 antigen, found on certain b-cell subsets, results in significant b-cell depletion and has been increasingly used in immune-mediated renal disease and transplantation. most positive data regarding the benefit of rituximab in immune-mediated kidney disease have come from uncontrolled cohort studies, with the only positive controlled clinical trials demonstrating efficacy for the treatment of systemic vasculitis. rituximab is a novel treatment that provides a clear alternative for patients in different clinical situations, and allows for customization of therapy. as rituximab specifically targets circulating b cells, we thought that it could be beneficial in preventing this immune-mediated transfusion complication. dhtr recurrence was successfully prevented by rituximab administration prior transfusion, supporting the safe use of rituximab to prevent dhtr in scd patients as a second line approach when other measures failed. these molecules are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (prrs) and can induce inflammation and immune responses in the absence of infection. the targeting of cd20 on normal, malignant and auto-immune b-lymphocytes by rituximab has demonstrated substantial benefits for patients with a variety of b-cell lymphomas, as well as some with autoimmune disorders. 
    SARSCoV2 is the virus. Covid 19 is the disease it causes. Just like HIV is a virus and AIDS is the disease it causes. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Do you know anything Janet?    https://t.co/KZsHsqFUmU [SEP] coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus that was identified in december 2019. in the wake of the current covid-19 pandemic, it appears that people living with hiv/aids are equally or slightly more susceptible to the etiologic agent, sars-cov-2, than the general population having intact immune systems, but they may have more serious outcomes. the spread of the serve acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which causes covid-19, [who. naming the coronavirus disease (covid-19) and the virus that causes it. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it] and is responsible for the covid-19 pandemic is another in a long line of coronavirus outbreak - and unlikely to be the last. influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. covid-19 pandemic is caused by a novel virus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus that infects cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, aided by proteases that prime the spike protein of the virus to enhance cellular entry. sars-cov-2 infection causes covid-19 disease. the emergence of novel virus sars-cov-2 that causes covid-19 has complicated africa's public health challenges, especially with the pre-existing epidemics such as hiv/aids. 
    Again anecdotally, I’ve spent the last few months giving falls leaflets and “Keeping Fit and Active” leaflets to my friends’ parents. I think the physical deconditioning from Covid has caused enormous problems in terms of falls risk, loss of muscle bulk and cognitive decline [SEP] being a woman (odds ratio [or]=1.62; 95% ci, 1.03-2.54), having a history of falls (or=1.15; 95% ci, 1.05-1.26), suffering acute health problems (or=2.19; 95% ci, 1.09-4.40), and doing moderate exercise (or=1.91; 95% ci, 1.08-3.38) were found as factors associated with a higher risk of falls. the most predictable effects of deconditioning are seen in the musculoskeletal system and include diminished muscle mass, decreases of muscle strength by two to five percent per day, muscle shortening, changes in periarticular and cartilaginous joint structure and marked loss of leg strength that seriously limit mobility. the decline in muscle mass and strength has been linked to falls, functional decline, increased frailty and immobility. falls in older persons are an important cause of injury, disability, and death. a fear of falls contributes to the problem by causing inactivity and deconditioning, further increasing the danger of falls. falls among older people are common and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. postural instability and falls erode confidence and result in a negative cycle of diminishing activity levels, further deconditioning and a higher risk of further falls. simple, practicable clinic-based tests of physical functioning, cognition and neurological function can help to identify those at high risk of falls and functional decline. falls and fall-related injuries are a serious cause of morbidity and cost to society. consistent with fear-avoidance models of falling and pain, past research has demonstrated that, among adults living in the community, excessive fear of falling and fear of pain result in activity restriction and predict functional outcomes including falls (possibly because self-imposed activity restriction, due to fear of pain or falling, can lead to muscular decline and deconditioning). 
I was much more sad that my work won't allow me to bring banana bread for everyone because of covid than I was to find out the j&j vaccine could cause blood clots [SEP] infection by the sars-cov-2 increases the risk for systematic multi-organ complications and venous, arterial thromboembolism. the need for an effective vaccine to combat the pandemic prompted the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and food and drug administration (fda) to approve a nationwide distribution of the ad26.cov2.s vaccine manufactured by johnson & johnson (j&j). this patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive pe and deep venous thrombosis (dvt) due to sars-cov2 infection following the administration of the j&j vaccine. adverse emboli growths with increased d-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the astrazeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt). administrative use of the j&j vaccine resumed in may 2021. nevertheless, a further detailed analysis must be conducted on the adverse thrombotic manifestations following adenoviral-based covid-19 vaccines (j&j, astrazeneca) compared to mrna-based vaccines (moderna, pfizer) to assess causality with higher specificity. on 13 april 2021, the us food and drug administration called for a halt in the administration of the johnson & johnson (j&j) covid-19 vaccine due to reports of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia being associated with vaccination. to assess the association of covid-19 vaccines and non-covid-19 vaccines with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst). we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). in conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by cha vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic saes. 
 Here‘s why you should get the vaccine. Covid causes inflammation to the central nervous system and can cause damage including strokes and psychosis. Since you play a game that also causes brain injuries, it would be best for you to not have your brain fight both. [SEP] recent surveys revealed a few alarming facts about covid-19, that, when it hits the brain, can cause some serious complications like; psychosis, stroke and dementia. covid-19 infection's main symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, and neurological manifestations such as headache, myalgias, anosmia, ageusia, impaired consciousness, seizures, and even neuromuscular junctions' disorders. due to the neurological symptoms associated with covid-19, damage in the central nervous system has been suggested as well as the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov-2. it is known that cov infections are associated with an inflammation process related to the imbalance of the antioxidant system; cellular changes caused by oxidative stress contribute to brain tissue damage. suppression of systemic immunity by the nervous system could protect the brain from additional inflammatory damage; however, it may increase the susceptibility to infection. growing evidence pieces show that viruses, such as covs, can enter the central nervous system from different pathways and inducing neurotoxicity. therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether sars-cov-2 has access to the central nervous system and can cause direct neuronal effects. therefore, is important to make clear whether sars-cov-2 lung damage can cause direct or indirect neuronal effects. neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in covid-19 patients, but the neurotropic potential of the virus is still debated. these findings add to the hypothesis that most of the neural damage caused by sars-cov-2 infection is due to a systemic inflammation leading to indirect harmful effects on the central nervous system despite the absence of local viral replication. 
 masks cause plague... fauci knows... masks promote bacteria... and not the good kind... sinus/lung/teeth and gum/tongue/etc... bacteriological infections... covid is crimes against humanity (:~:)https://t.co/VvPRwcVGPx [SEP] to determine patterns of mask wearing and other infection prevention behaviours, over two time periods of the covid-19 pandemic, in cities where mask wearing was not a cultural norm. data were analysed according to the epidemiology of covid-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. in the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic (spanish flu), health care professionals began to use face masks in a routine way to protect themselves and their patients. it is not by chance, therefore, that one of the consequences of the 2020 ongoing covid-19 pandemic should be the fact that face masks have become essential again both inside and outside health care environments. masks have become one of the most indispensable pieces of personal protective equipment and are important strategic products during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. in this article, we report a very simple approach for the decontamination of masks for multiple reuse during the covid-19 pandemic. currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of covid-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for covid-19. therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals wearing masks can still infect others due to viable microbial loads escaping from the masks. for this reason, during the current pandemic, many researchers have worked to develop face masks made of advanced materials with intrinsic antimicrobial, self-cleaning, reusable, and/or biodegradable properties, thereby providing extra protection against pathogens in a sustainable manner. protective facial masks reduce the spread of covid-19 infection and save lives. 
 yeah pfzier causes blood clots and tumors too and j&j causes blood clots but they're RARE and you really don't want covid instead [SEP] this viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. thrombotic complications and thrombocytopenia increase the risk for blood clot growth due to the inflammation of immune complexes by pro-thrombotic activation of anti-platelet antibodies. this patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive pe and deep venous thrombosis (dvt) due to sars-cov2 infection following the administration of the j&j vaccine. bilateral thrombus opacities and pulmonary emboli are consistent among covid-19 patients by intravascular coagulation with increased prothrombin time and d-dimer concentration with a low platelet count. adverse emboli growths with increased d-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the astrazeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt). there is emerging evidence for covid-19 being a blood clotting disorder and sars-cov-2 using the respiratory route to enter the blood stream. although antiviral and immune therapies are studied, the role of blood thinners in the prevention, and management of blood clots in covid-19 need evaluation. elevated d-dimers implicate clotting as well. since sfmc constitutes the input to intravascular fibrin clots and d-dimer reflects fibrin clot dissolution, it was thought that the two tests, run in tandem along with assays of immune activation, might clarify the frequency and possibly the cause of dic in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia. classical dic with intravascular clotting and thrombocytopenia was documented only rarely. 
AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine is linked to another bleeding disorder that can cause purple-dotted rash https://t.co/NhPMh8uQkI [SEP] we present the case of a 48-year-old caucasian woman, who developed an acute urticarial rash after the second dose of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccination with oxford-astrazeneca. in this case series, we discuss the incidence of widespread rashes that develop in some individuals after receiving covid-19 vaccines by both astrazeneca (astrazeneca plc, cambridge, uk) and pfizer-biontech (pfizer inc., brooklyn, ny; biontech se, mainz, germany). emerging evidence suggest a possible association between immune thrombocytopenia (itp) and some formulations of covid-19 vaccine. itp is the second haematological adverse event, distinct from that of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts), observed following astrazeneca vaccination. this study aimed to determine the frequency of reported thrombotic adverse events and clinical outcomes for these three covid-19 vaccines, namely, moderna, pfizer and oxford-astrazeneca. to describe the clinical manifestations and the concerning management of patients with cranial venous sinus thrombosis following first exposure to the "covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca". three women with intracranial venous sinus thrombosis after their first vaccination with "covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca" were encountered. early observations insinuate that the exposure to the "covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca" might trigger the expression of antiplatelet antibodies, resulting in a condition with thrombocytopenia and venous thrombotic events (e.g., intracranial venous sinus thrombosis). vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt) is a prothrombotic disorder, which has been described as a rare adverse effect of the adenoviral-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccines. here, we report a case of a patient who presented with a severe intracerebral hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia 14 days after receiving the first dose of the oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine, with negative pf4/heparin antibodies tested with elisa, but positive heparin-induced platelet activation assay (hipaa). 
Secrets of ANCIENT AYURVEDA prevented AUTO IMMUNE DISEASES.CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL only IVERMECTIN can save planet from COVID (AS OF NOW),NOT VACCINES which causes every vaccinated human to be a DEVIL’S WORKSHOP to create MUTATED STRAINS OF SARS COV 2 VIRUS.  [NEWLINE]https://t.co/ZBFscnhjx1 [SEP] induction of herd immunity by mass vaccination has been a very successful strategy for preventing the spread of many infectious diseases, hence protecting the most vulnerable population groups unable to develop immunity, for example individuals with immunodeficiencies or a weakened immune system due to underlying medical or debilitating conditions. therefore, vaccination represents one of the most promising counter-pandemic measures to covid-19. nevertheless, covid-19 vaccines will be essential in the future for reducing morbidity and mortality and inducing herd immunity, if sars-cov-2 becomes established in the population like for example influenza virus. our objective of this literature review is to review the role of immunity in pathogenesis of covid-19 and role of ayush kwath against the virus and regulation of immunity. current review was conducted using a search of available literature on covid-19 and immunity, vyadhikshamatwa, ayurveda and covid-19, rasayana, coronavirus, sars-cov-2, immunomodulatory effects of medicinal plants; tulsi/holy basil/ocimum sanctum, dalchini/cinnamon/cinnamomum zeylanicum, sunthi/ginger/zingiber officinale and marich/black pepper/piper nigrum. ayurveda, being an ancient science have both medicinal and cultural values and had stimulated our kitchen and influenced what we ate in different seasons and the remedies we used for common ailments. thus, ayush kwath due to its immune-modulatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerotic, hepato-protective, reno-protective properties; seems to be effective in immuno-regulation for controlling viral infections like covid-19. a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine that can elicit the necessary immune response is necessary to end the epidemic. this mucosal vaccine strategy inhibited sars-cov-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract, thus preventing disease progression to the lower respiratory tract. a piv5-based mucosal vaccine provides a strategy to induce protective innate and cellular immune responses and reduce sars-cov-2 infection and transmission in populations. 
  The error in dealing with the Covid19 was preventing treatments without the so called vaccine. HCQ and Ivermectin were/are good treatments. That cause a large number of unnecessary deaths. And then the nursing home insanity. Bureaucrap and ComDem_Covid_Dictators. [SEP] the purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of pfizer-biontech covid19 vaccine among nursing home residents by exploring the outcomes of a major covid-19 outbreak following covid-19 vaccination in a nursing home located at a metropolitan area of south-central texas. completion of both doses of covid vaccination for all nursing home residents is essential and can prevent future covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. theoretically covid19-excluded subjects (pcr-negative) suffered ten-times greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-covid19 subjects, which points to the existence of considerable number of false negative results in earlier pcr testing and could explain part of the global excess all-cause mortality observed during the pandemic. in this paper, we are presenting the current status of evidence for using cq and hcq against covid19. in the absence of an approved, recognized effective pre or post-exposure prophylactic drug or vaccine for covid-19, nor of any approved and validated therapeutic drug, coupled with social and political pressure raised by publicity both regarding the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine (hcq) as well as potential risks from hcq, we urge the immediate proper clinical trials. nearly a year into the covid-19 pandemic, we still lack effective anti-sars-cov-2 drugs with substantial impact on mortality rates except for dexamethasone. cohort studies that assessed the use of hcq for covid-19 reported conflicting results, but randomized controlled trials (rcts) demonstrated no effect on mortality rates and no substantial clinical benefits of hcq used either for prevention or treatment of covid-19. while the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs cq/hcq could be a potent therapeutic against covid-19. as there is no cure for covid-19, clinical testing of hcq is urgently required to determine its potency against sars-cov-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. we summarize the covid19 tragedy in elderly care in sweden, particularly in the city of stockholm. 
Giving yourself a tension headache by worrying that you might get a headache which could indicate that you’ve developed blood clots after your covid jab, even though you know you didn’t have the one that can cause blood clots and just scared yourself reading the side-effects. https://t.co/0kokui7ui6 [SEP] secondary headache is one of the most common side effect during oral contraceptive (oc) treatment and it leads many patients to stop the therapy. headache, in particular migraine-like and tension types, has been largely reported in patients suffering from covid-19 both in the acute and the healing phase of the infection. two patients with persistent headache and sars-cov-2 infection were identified. clinical evaluation of covid-19 patients presenting with persistent headache should take into consideration ndph. we describe a 37-year-old female patient with multiple intense, jabbing headache episodes over the last 3 years that occur exclusively during airplane flights. headache is a commonly associated side effect of the use of such equipment among healthcare workers. in this cross-sectional study, 243 frontline healthcare workers at four referral hospitals for covid-19 were evaluated for the occurrence of headache following the use of ppe and its relationship with blood gas parameters was assessed. among patients, 25.1% developed external pressure, 22.2% migraine, and 15.2% tension-type headaches. after receiving the vaccine, some people experienced pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, and nausea. very recent findings reveal that 20-30% of patients at high risk of mortality from covid-19 infection experience blood clotting that leads to stroke and sudden death. 
  I too have autoimmune disease. I have been vaccinated fully. The danger of Covid 19 outweighed the risk of side effects. The only side effect I had? Was flu like symptoms with the second dose. No lasting effect. The unvaccinated are the new 21 st century Lepers. Cause Variants [SEP] covid-19 vaccination side effects, such as fever, which occur in up to 10% of people following covid-19 vaccination, can make the diagnosis of acute hiv infection even more challenging. a 26-year-old man presented with fever and headache following covid-19 vaccination. the incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (rcts) demonstrating that covid-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. the benefits of covid-19 vaccination currently outweigh the side effect profile and are recommended as the first-line approach to control the current pandemic. common covid-19 vaccines side effects are pain at the injection site, muscle pain, fever, headaches, fatigue. immune-mediated side effects remain a rare event, thus the benefits of covid-19 vaccines outweigh the risk of disease flares and we strongly recommend it in all eligible patients with aa. τo report outcomes of breakthrough covid-19 in comparison with covid-19 in unvaccinated patients with systemic rheumatic diseases (srds). vaccinated patients with srd with breakthrough covid-19 have better outcomes compared with unvaccinated counterparts with similar disease/treatment characteristics. from a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had covid-19 ten days after vaccination. 
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause a disorder characterized by dangerous blood clots and low platelet counts. In Europe, at least 222 suspected cases have been reported among people who have received the vaccine. More than 30 have died. [SEP] on 18 march 2021, ema's safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt). we report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine administration. results: on 19 march 2021, out of 13.6 million women aged ≤ 50 exposed to at least one dose of pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines in the us, only 61 cases were reported with a total of 68 thromboembolic events (1 case per 222,951 vaccinated). here in, we report three cases of severe immune thrombocytopenia (itp) following covid-19 vaccination and their clinical course. introduction prompted by reports of thromboembolic events - some with fatal outcomes - among people who had received the chadox1 ncov-19 (azd1222) vaccine from oxford-astrazeneca against covid-19, a number of european countries paused vaccination with this vaccine in early and mid-march 2021. we therefore investigated whether vaccine willingness dropped in the wake of the reported cases of thromboembolic events in relation to the oxford-astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine. the present paper outlines the hypotheses on the mechanisms behind the very rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia reported after the covid-19 vaccination, along with currently existing evidence and future research prospects. covid-19 vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) is one of potential life-threating complication. covid-19 vaccine-induced tts has been reported as a very rare complication after the chadox1 ncov-19 (astrazeneca) vaccination and usually manifesting as cerebral venous thrombosis or pulmonary artery embolism. in a time where there is a strategic goal to vaccinate the global population from covid-19 to inhibit the spread of infection and reduce hospitalisation, this particular clinical scenario emphasises the need of all clinicians to remain vigilant for rare complications of the covid-19 vaccination. 
 Allopathic medicines are very costly. They eliminate the symptoms of diseases and cause other diseases in the body.  Asharamji Bapu has got many side effects in His body with allopathic medicines in the treatment of covid, so we demand for Ayurvedic medicine. #आयुर्वेद_हमारी_शान [SEP] ayurvedic and allopathic treatments have been studied extensively and approached for the cure of covid-19. comparative analysis of ayurveda and allopathic treatment strategies were carried out in the present study. depending upon the patient's conditions and symptoms, ayurveda is useful for the treatment of covid-19. in this article, we summarize different ayurvedic and allopathic medicines and treatment strategies which have been used for the treatment of covid-19, a global pandemic. there has been an increase in demand for the phytopharmaceutical products of ayurvĕda in western countries, because of the fact that the allopathic drugs have more side effects. ayurvĕda is the indian traditional system of medicine, which also deals about pharmaceutical science. ayurveda care may be considered as first-line cost-effective alternative for covid-19 patients presenting with symptomatic hypoxia in an integrative setup. how ayurvedic medicine can be integrated with allopathic medicine is also discussed in this review. ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in india, particularly in rural india, where 70% of the population lives. the focus on non-allopathic systems of medicine in india can be attributed to various causes including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the country's population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. 
 LOSE WEIGHT!!!! More than 40% of US citizens are obese! Obesity causes diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, cancer, etc., i.e. exactly those underlying health problems which increase the risk of dying from Covid, also for younger people! LOSE WEIGHT NOW TO REDUCE RISK [SEP] the united states is experiencing an epidemic of obesity among both adults and children. while people often wish to lose weight for the sake of their appearance, public health concerns about obesity relate to this disease's link to numerous chronic diseases that can lead to premature illness and death. health risks also increase with excess abdominal/visceral fat (as estimated by a waist-hip ratio [whr] > 1.0 for males and > 0.8 for females), high blood pressure (> 140/90), dyslipidemias (total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of > 200 and > 225 mg/dl, respectively), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and a family history of premature death due to cardiovascular disease (e.g., parent, grandparent, sibling, uncle, or aunt dying before age 50). the high prevalence of obesity in the united states together with its link to numerous chronic diseases leads to the conclusion that this disease is responsible for a substantial proportion of total health-care costs. this article explores the rising incidence of overweight and obesity in the united states, the reasons so many people fail to lose weight or maintain a weight loss, and the potential for nurses to turn the tide on this epidemic. because being overweight increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, the rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the united states represents a major health problem. more than one-third of adults in the united states are obese and, therefore, subject to elevated rates of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. as obesity becomes an ever greater public health problem, additional interventions with long-term efficacy are needed to reduce body weight and maintain weight loss. more than one-third of adults in the united states are obese and, therefore, subject to elevated rates of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. as obesity becomes an ever greater public health problem, additional interventions with long-term efficacy are needed to reduce body weight and maintain weight loss. 
    COVID can cause horrible and debilitating secondary effects among those who survive. Lung, heart, and brain issues, as well as blood clots and circulation issues, have all been linked to COVID.  They don't go away when the initial infection is resolved. https://t.co/1gLEegZStL [SEP] covid-19 spans a wide range of symptoms, sometimes with profound immune system involvement. infection by sars-cov-2 produces significant pulmonary pathology including endothelial damage with resultant thrombotic events. the major features in the lungs of covid-19 patients comprised primary inflammatory thrombosis associated with diffuse alveolar damage. while the lungs are the primary target for the sars-cov-2-mediated pathological consequence, the virus appears to invade the brain and cause unpredicted neurological deficits. in the later stage, covid-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurodegeneration and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. though a significant portion of individuals with covid-19 has been recovering from clinical symptoms, the pathological impact of the sars-cov-2 infection on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. the brain is among the targets of covid-19, and it can be impacted in multiple ways, both directly and indirectly. secondary mechanisms involve hypoxia due to respiratory failure, as well as aberrant immune response leading to various forms of encephalopathy, white matter damage, and abnormal blood clotting resulting in stroke. since covid-19 is a new disease, it will take months or even years to characterize the exact nature, scope, and temporal extent of its long-term neurocognitive sequelae. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the cause of the novel respiratory disease covid-19, has reached pandemic status and presents a wide range of manifestations of diverse magnitude, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and damage to vital organs, such as the heart, lung, kidney, and brain. 
 My family of 4, NO SIDE EFFECTS!! Just saw a Real Housewife blaming her ZIT on the Covid vaccine! People are so damn stupid!! Vaccines don't cause pimples!! [SEP] after receiving the vaccine, some people experienced pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, and nausea. this study examined the mediating role of concerns about the adverse reactions to the covid-19 vaccine in the relationship between attitudes toward the effectiveness of the vaccine and proactively taking the vaccine for family. attitudes toward the effectiveness of vaccines were positively correlated with proactively taking the covid-19 vaccine for family. additionally, concerns about the side effects to the sars-cov-2 vaccine mediated the relationship between attitudes toward the effectiveness of vaccines and proactively taking vaccines for family. we asked participants how likely they thought side effects from covid-19 vaccination were. most participants were uncertain whether they would experience side effects from a covid-19 vaccine; only a minority reported that side effects were very likely (9.4%, 95% ci 7.9% to 10.9%, n = 138/1470). side-effect expectation was associated with believing that covid-19 vaccination was unsafe, ineffective and that others would be less likely to approve of you having a covid-19 vaccination. side effects of vaccines are common, but people react differently to different vaccines. side effects as a result of vaccination are not rare and are proof that the immune system is responding. this study aimed to provide evidence on sinopharm covid-19 vaccine side effects. 
    Ffs! I don't know how many more times it can be explained to people really.[NEWLINE]Just because you have cancer or a brain tumour or anything else terminal. There are other causes of death that expedite the original cause of illness. Covid is one of those things. [SEP] for two reasons: firstly it seemed to me so little time had passed since the previous issue about this disease and perhaps there weren't many new things to say and secondly i believed that the only topic worth discussing nowadays was the disease that overshadowed anything else: covid-19. the covid-19 pandemic has affected the entire planet in almost every aspect of life, including the medical system. as the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other covid-19-related challenges. the pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. in this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of covid-19, especially among older persons. in light of the current pandemic, we also consider the parallels between the el epidemic and neurological manifestations of covid-19. understanding how pathogens and autoimmune processes can affect the brain may well help us understand the conundrum of el and, more importantly, will guide the treatment of patients with suspected covid-19-related neurological disease, as well as prepare us for any future epidemic of a neurological illness. 
Brazil regulator rejects Sputnik V vaccine citing serious quality, safety concerns. Cells where adenovirus is produced “allow its replication,” which “can lead to infections in humans and can cause injury and death” #COVID19 #coronavirus  #CoronaVaccine  https://t.co/OHd3NbLcEm [SEP] sputnik v is one of the most promising vaccines, utilizing an adenovirus vector to cause immunity against sars-cov-2. concerns existed against adenovirus infection with this vaccine, although seemed to be a rare event. in this study, we observed that 15/18 (83%) of the children of the sputnik v recipients became symptomatic and developed transient fever and chills for 1-2 days starting after 2-5 days following the vaccination of their parents that can be related to an adenovirus infection. the approved formulations of astrazeneca, jnj, and gam-covid-vac (sputnik v) contain dna delivered within non-replicating recombinant adenovirus vector-based systems, while the pfizer and moderna vaccines utilize mrna technology and lipid nanoparticle delivery systems. the sputnik v covid-19 vaccine is a member of the so-called vector vaccines and uses two different vectors (ad26 priming and ad5 boost) to reduce the risk of a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccination. furthermore, there is emerging documentation that sputnik v has a reduced neutralizing capacity against the beta variant and all variants with the spike protein carrying the e484k substitution. nevertheless, due to its characteristics, sputnik v could be another useful means of satisfying the need for mass vaccination. however, it is imperative to document the efficacy and safety of the sputnik v vaccine in individuals with high pre-existing anti-ad26 and ad5-neutralizing antibody titres and in those under the age of 18 or older than 60 years and be certain that sputnik v does not cause the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. sputnik is a new viral entity carrying an almost complete ready-to-use set of viral rnas (20 out of 21). this work provides new insight into the sputnik replication cycle with another giant virus and confirms that sputnik is a virophage. 
Such a dangerous decision. There were 6 instances out of 7 million vaccinations. Blood clots are a known complication of COVID-19, so it is not surprising that the immune response may cause them. Further, FDA approved birth control has an incidence of 1 in 1,000, yet still used. https://t.co/gOEZlCOQMu [SEP] recently, the food and drug administration (fda) has approved the emergency use of pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccine on december 12, 2020. however, there are concern about the new covid-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. three covid-19 vaccines are currently approved under a biologics license application (bla) or authorized under an emergency use authorization (eua) by the food and drug administration (fda) and recommended for primary vaccination by the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) in the united states: the 2-dose mrna-based pfizer-biontech/comirnaty and moderna covid-19 vaccines and the single-dose adenovirus vector-based janssen (johnson & johnson) covid-19 vaccine (1,2) (box 1). the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). in conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by cha vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic saes. the blood of the covid-19 patients were found to clotted than the patients were prescribed the anticoagulant injections are prescribed. after emergency use authorization of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine by the food and drug administration (fda), acip issued an interim recommendation for use of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥16 years at its december 12, 2020, meeting (1). after emergency use authorization of moderna covid-19 vaccine by fda, acip issued an interim recommendation for use of moderna covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years at its december 19, 2020, emergency meeting (2). however, only a few drugs have been approved in certain areas and for use in conditional patients, and the vaccine candidates were only recently approved or authorized for emergency use without being fully implemented worldwide, suggesting that we are yet to reach effective control of the current outbreak as its uninhibited transmission continues precariously. 
           In other words (translation into English), what u and those looking at cholinergic system disruption ( ) are saying is that neurological distress  leads to respiratory distress in covid, that neuro-mediated hypoximia causes covid pneumonia? [SEP] covid-19 disease can lead to multiple complications such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), coagulopathy, renal failure, cardiac and neurological complications. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is known to be primarily a viral infection affecting the pulmonary system leading to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. the characteristic symptom of covid-19 is respiratory distress with diffused alveolar damage, but emerging evidence suggests covid-19 might also have neurologic consequences. this review makes references to the neuro-immune axis and neuro-invasive potential of sars-cov and sars-cov2, as well as the prototypic h-cov strains in human brains. simultaneously, considerable discussion on relevant experimental evidence of mild to severe neurological manifestations of fellow neurotropic murine-β-covs (m-covs) in the mouse model will help understand the underpinning mechanisms of neuro-covid. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), causes serious respiratory illness manifesting as pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. a 38-year female patient developed severe respiratory distress with sars-cov-2 infection and was treated in intensive care unit (icu). severe covid-19 pneumonia shares some pathological similarities with severe bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. sympathetic over-activation in covid-19 is correlated with increase in capillary pulmonary leakage, alveolar damage, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. furthermore, sars-cov-2 can spread through pulmonary mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors to medullary respiratory center in a retrograde manner resulting in sudden respiratory failure. 
   You are mistaken.  COVID-19 antibodies are ONLY made when a person gets the virus.  Whether a person gets sick depends on how healthy their immune system is or other factors.  Vaccines cause antibodies to be made by a person, without getting sick, just like in asym infections. [SEP] understanding immune reactivity against sars-cov-2 is essential for coping with the covid-19 pandemic. some people react excellently without experiencing any clinical symptoms, they do not get sick, and they do not pass the virus on to anyone else ("sterilizing" immunity). others produce antibodies and do not get covid-19 but transmit the virus to others ("protective" immunity). in reality, covid-19 is considered more of a systemic immune-vascular disease than a pulmonic disease, involving many tissues and the central nervous system. overall, lower and more delayed antibody responses following covid-19 vaccination were observed in patients with mhd than in healthy controls in the settings of different populations, vaccines and dosage, definitions of the immune response, and antibody detection timepoints. younger age, previous covid-19 infection, and higher serum albumin level were positively associated with antibody formation, whereas older age and receiving immunosuppressive therapy were unfavorable factors. however, it remains uncertain between the elicited antibodies following vaccination and the genuine protection against covid-19 infection. we also tested samples collected from different households, and demonstrated differences in the immune response of covid-19 patients and their family members; identifying, in particular, asymptomatic cases showing strong presence of studied antibodies, and cases showing none despite confirmed close contacts with the infected individuals. it should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against covid-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. lower concern regarding covid-19 was also associated with more negative responses to taking a potential covid-19 vaccine. 
 We need to realize that COVID is a disorder of the Immune system. A disordered immune response leads to acute critical COVID and chronic inflammation causes PASC, #Leronlimab is an immunomodulator that has shown to help both groups of patients! [SEP] severe-to-critical covid-19 is associated with a dysregulated host immune response to the virus, which is thought to lead to pathogenic immune dysregulation and end-organ damage. leronlimab is a humanized igg4, kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks c-c chemokine receptor type 5 (ccr5). it has been shown that in patients with severe covid-19 treatment with leronlimab reduces elevated plasma il-6 and chemokine ligand 5 (ccl5), and normalized cd4/cd8 ratios. we administered leronlimab to 4 critically ill covid-19 patients in intensive care. recently, the emergence of post-acute sequelae of covid-19 (pasc) or long covid highlighted the impact of pas. leronlimab, a ccr5-specific humanised igg4 monoclonal antibody originally developed for the treatment of hiv has been studied for the treatment of covid-19. the results show that day 28 mortality was reduced (p ​= ​0.0319) in the subset of participants receiving leronlimab plus other pre-specified commonly used covid-19 treatments including dexamethasone administered as part of their standard of care (soc) compared to participants receiving placebo plus other pre-specified commonly used covid-19 treatments including dexamethasone as part of their soc. several cases have recently been reported demonstrated that treatment with leronlimab restores immune function and achieves clinical improvement in people with critical covid-19. here, we report that neuro-pasc patients have a specific signature composed of humoral and cellular immune responses that are biased towards different structural proteins compared to healthy covid convalescents. dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe covid-19 disease. 
      I wish more attention would be paid to the importance of the Pentose-Phosphate-Pathway in optimal immune function & how COVID demands G6PD/NADPH, etc - & inability of the body to supply can cause ALL severe &/or long reactions [SEP] proteomic and metabolomic analyzes revealed that g6pd play a key role in regulating pentose phosphate pathway and subsequently upregulating nadph consuming pathways such as fatty acid synthesis, thus eventually leading to lipid accumulation. thus, we provide a cell-active small molecule tool for oxidative pentose phosphate pathway inhibition, and use it to identify g6pd as a pharmacological target for modulating immune response. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway in carbohydrate metabolism. recently, there has been a renewed interest in the role of the pentose phosphate pathway in cancer. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) catalyzes the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, a reaction that generates nadph. we conclude that g6pd activity is dispensable for pentose synthesis, but is essential to protect cells against even mild oxidative stress. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that ensures sufficient production of coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) by catalyzing the reduction of nadp+ to nadph. therefore, patients with severe forms of g6pd deficiency may present impaired nadph oxidase activity and become susceptible to recurrent infections. this fact, highlights the importance to characterize the immunopathologic mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to infections in patients with g6pd deficiency. our data expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of g6pd deficiency, and suggest that impaired oxidative burst in this severe primary immune deficiency is an underlying immunopathologic mechanism that predisposes to mycobacterial infections. 
  Yes, COVID-19 can cause various problems. The VACCINE cannot. [SEP] the significant number of people who remain undecided about whether or not to get a covid-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies, is concerning. background: vaccination is an important preventative measure against the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic. the perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting covid-19 under the perceived benefit construct (or = 3.14, 95% ci 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new covid-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (or = 1.65, 95% ci 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the covid-19 vaccine. the availability of a covid-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the covid-19 pandemic. common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around covid-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. ensuring widespread uptake of available covid-19 vaccinations, each with different safety and efficacy profiles, is essential to combating the unfolding pandemic. perceived effectiveness was also higher among those given information about their assigned vaccine's effectiveness at preventing death from covid-19 (b, 0.03; 95% ci, 0.01 to 0.05) and lower among those given information about their assigned vaccine's overall efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection (b, -0.05; 95% ci, -0.08 to -0.03), compared with those who were not given this information. the deleterious effects caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection have been compounded by covid-19 vaccine hesitancy throughout the world, including pakistan. more information on covid-19 vaccine safety in pwms would be helpful for people to make informed decisions. background the pandemic of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (covid-19) poses a major public health challenge, and an effective vaccine is the potential mechanism to resolve this specific situation. 
  Covid 19 causes blood clots that trigger heart attacks and strokes, explains why he was in perfect condition a few weeks ago, but the disease was silently ravaging his body [SEP] blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 infection. remarkably, more than 70% of deaths related to covid-19 are attributed to clotting-associated complications such as pulmonary embolism, strokes and multi-organ failure. blood clots are a central feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) and can culminate in pulmonary embolism, stroke, and sudden death. however, it is not known how abnormal blood clots form in covid-19 or why they occur even in asymptomatic and convalescent patients. here we report that the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) binds to the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen and induces structurally abnormal blood clots with heightened proinflammatory activity. sars-cov-2 spike induces structurally abnormal blood clots and thromboinflammation neutralized by a fibrin-targeting antibody. most heart attacks and strokes are caused by blood clots (thrombi) that block the vasculature. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a prominent pandemic disease that emerged in china and hurriedly stretched worldwide. there are many reports on covid-19 associated with the amplified incidence of thrombotic events. in this review, we focused on covid-19 coupled with the coagulopathy contributes to severe outcome inclusive of comorbidities such as venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes, lung, heart attack, aki, and liver injury. 
Oxygen deprivation caused by face masks is weakening your immune system and harming your body.  Do not consent to this ritual which does nothing to prevent illness but actually causes it. #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #Health #healthylifestyle #HealthyLiving #healthy [SEP] among the strategic measures face mask is one of the most used measures to prevent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). wearing a face mask possibly create a false sense of security lead to decline others measures. face mask could be risk for the people of under lying medical conditions, old age group, outdoor exercise, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and feeble innate immune. restrictive airflow due to face mask is the main cause of retention of co2 called hypercapnia that can lead to respiratory failure with symptoms of tachycardia, flushed skin, dizziness, papilledema, seizure and depression. according to latest updates face shield and social distancing could be better substitute of face mask. this study examined four cases of assisted suicide by oxygen deprivation using helium delivered via a face mask. swiss law prevented attendants from effectively managing the face mask apparatus. oxygen deprivation with a face mask is not acceptable because leaks are difficult to control and it may not eliminate rebreathing. a smart mask integrated with a remote, noncontact multiplexed sensor system, or "lab-on-mask" (lom) is designed for monitoring respiratory diseases, such as the covid-19. an alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. 
      It can be vasovagal syncope (which is basically a faint) - this is relatively common with flu for example which can cause people to feel dizzy/faint, but also with stress. It could be completely unrelated - e.g. a heart arrhythmia leading to collapse. [SEP] this article aims to provide the practitioner with a pragmatic and logical approach to identifying the cardiovascular causes of dizziness and loss of consciousness. a range of disorders with varying pathology cause a transient loss of consciousness associated with postural collapse (syncope) by interruption of blood flow to the brain. the vasovagal reaction or 'common faint' and postural hypotension are both common and benign causes of syncope. humans may have developed the characteristic of emotional fainting as a response to anticipated blood loss. prodromal symptoms often accompany fainting of vasovagal origin, while the occurrence of syncope without warning in a patient with cardiac problems suggests arrhythmia. vasovagal syncope, or the "common faint", is the most common cause of syncope. vasovagal syncope is an exaggerated form of the common faint affecting all age groups. people who experience vasovagal syncope, a heritable tendency to fainting induced by emotional challenges (and needle/blood phobia), are also more vulnerable to anxiety disorders. vasovagal syncope (vvs) is a common form of fainting. although vasovagal syncope is essentially equivalent to simple fainting, the physiologic events that lead to this phenomena are complex. 
 Masks are a total hoax!! They do not stop the spread of corona virus,in fact bacteria levels are high from wearing the mask a couple of hours&we breathe in all that bacteria in to our lungs which can/does cause pneumonia&pneumonia kills. Let that sink In. Masks can kill us. [SEP] wearing face masks has been widely recommended to contain respiratory virus diseases, yet the improper use of masks poses a threat of jeopardizing the protection effect. our results improve the safe use of masks and benefit the environment. one of the most adopted prevention measures that can limit the spread of the airborne virus in the form of respiratory viral diseases, including the new strain of covid-19, is wearing a proper mask. to curb the spread of the covid-19 virus, the use of face masks such as disposable surgical masks and n95 respirators is being encouraged and even enforced in some countries. a mask that creates a physical barrier to protect the wearer from breathing in airborne bacteria or viruses, reducing the risk of infection in polluted air and potentially contaminated environments, has become a daily necessity for the public especially as covid-19 has exploded around the world. in order to reveal the epidemic prevention efficacy of masks, this paper systematically evaluates the experimental studies of various masks and filter materials, summarises the general characteristics of the filtration efficiency of isolation masks with particle size, and reveals the actual efficacy of masks by combining the volume distribution characteristics of human exhaled droplets with different particle sizes and the sars-cov-2 virus load of nasopharynx and throat swabs from patients. from the perspective of filtering the total number of pathogens discharged in the environment and protecting vulnerable individuals from breathing live viruses, the mask has a higher protective effect. the mask can avoid releasing active viruses to the environment from the source of infection, thus maximising the protection of vulnerable individuals by reducing the probability of inhaling a virus. since the start of the covid-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. 
 I don't consider ppls fears irrational in the least.  AZ drops platelets=could impact ppl with blood cancer badly.  TTS is extremely rare, meaning few things cause it other than AZ & Heparin.  The other name for it is 'Vaccine induced TTS'. 61 cases so far https://t.co/HqEMGTHIS7 [SEP] thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) has been associated with the astrazencea (az) covid-19 vaccine (vaxzevria). we used the model to compare estimated deaths from az vaccine-associated tts with i) covid-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from covid-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). the thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts), a complication of covid-19 vaccines, involves thrombosis (often cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and thrombocytopenia with occasional pulmonary embolism and arterial ischemia. the prevailing opinion of most experts is that the risk of developing covid-19 disease, including thrombosis, far exceeds the extremely low risk of tts associated with highly efficacious vaccines. although interim analyses of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of covid-19 vaccines, a serious but rare adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts), has been reported following covid-19 vaccination. intravenous immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids may help increase the platelet count within days and reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation when anticoagulation is initiated.what is the impact?tts should be a serious concern during the implementation of mass covid-19 vaccination, and patients should be educated about this complication along with its symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, seizure, severe and persistent abdominal pain, painful swelling of the lower leg, and chest pain or dyspnea. however, recent reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) associated with adenovirus vector vaccines have raised concern. tts, also known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, is a reaction associated with exposure to the chadox1 ncov-19 (oxford-astrazeneca) and ad26.cov2·s (johnson & johnson) vaccine, which may result in thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events. covid-19 vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) is one of potential life-threating complication. early recognition of adenoviral vector vaccine-related tts, which resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome, is important as heparin and heparin analogues are best avoided in the treatment. 
  It isn’t denial... the real issue is the mental health problems that your lockdown measures have and will cause.  Suicides and opioid OD are going to be far higher than any Covid deaths and to much younger and physically healthier individuals. [SEP] however, mental health experts warn that the prolonged lockdown, quarantine, or isolation will create a "second pandemic" with severe mental health issues and suicides. as with the sars outbreak in 2003, many suicide cases have been reported in connection with this current covid-19 pandemic lockdown due to various factors such as social stigma, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, fear of covid infection, loneliness, and other mental health issues. background: the covid-19-induced lockdown has been implemented in many countries, which may cause unfavorable changes in lifestyles and psychological health. conclusion: the covid-19 lockdown measure could negatively affect eating behavior, physical activity, and mental health among outpatients. the covid-19 pandemic and resulting public health measures may have major impacts on mental health, including on self-harm. of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (n = 107) covid-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. covid-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. we explored the impacts of the covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support in austria. our study is the first to assess the capability limiting aspects of lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities alongside their impacts on mental health and social support. the negative capability well-being, mental health and social support impacts of the covid-19 lockdown were strongest for people with a history of mental health treatment. 
  To quote from the article "There is no proof, however, that the vaccine caused these cases" Also "COVID-19 itself can cause myocarditis" [SEP] although the number of cases reported have been small in comparison with the large number of people vaccinated, myocarditis may be a rare adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccination that is now only becoming apparent due to the widespread use of the vaccine. the patient had a previous infection with sars-cov-2 approximately two months prior to the onset of his symptoms, but since he had fully recovered before the time of his presentation to the ed, it is unlikely that the infection caused the myocarditis. myocarditis has been reported with covid-19 but is not clearly recognized as a possible adverse event following covid-19 vaccination. clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after covid-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes. although imputability of the vaccine cannot be formally established on the basis of this case report, the findings raise the possibility of an association between mrna covid-19 vaccination and acute myocarditis. we report a case series of 5 young male patients with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr)-confirmed acute myocarditis within 72 h after receiving a dose of an mrna-based covid-19 vaccine. in conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and covid-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying cmr abnormalities. background: a possible association has been reported between covid-19 mrna vaccination and myocarditis. myocarditis following administration of covid-19 vaccines, especially those based on mrna, has also been described. according to the reports so far, myocarditis related to mrna covid-19 vaccination is rare and usually associated with a benign clinical course without intensive care or any sequelae of fulminant myocarditis. 
 People are not experts at understanding absolute and relative risk. -The vaccine may cause this as do other meds and infections -The risk is so low that it's hard to find a background rate and prove it's above baseline -It's a hell of a lot lower than thrombotic risk of COVID [SEP] moreover, new vaccines and their rare thrombotic side effects have increased the concern about this issue.the goal of this review is to go over the mechanisms that lead up to thrombosis during covid-19, trying to explain the possible reasons why women seem to be naturally protected. moreover, available data about the so-called 'vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia' caused by vaccines against covid-19 are discussed. concerns about efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccines, as well as doubts, not yet fully clarified in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, represent other important factors for a low vaccination rate in people with (cv). this report documents the first fatal case of rhabdomyolysis potentially associated with the covid-19 vaccine and supports the possibility that autoimmunity is a major risk factor for covid vaccine-related rhabdomyolysis. these findings indicate that some groups of individuals may be more vaccination hesitant because they are more concerned about vaccine safety than covid-19 infection. there are concerns about a link between the chadox1 ncov-19 and ad26.cov2.s vaccines against covid-19 and cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt) and other thrombotic events. one key missing component of the risk-benefit analysis of using such vaccines is the risk of these severe thrombotic events following covid-19. the risks were compared to cohorts of patients with influenza (diagnosed within the same period) and people receiving an mrna vaccine (i.e. this was significantly higher than in a matched cohort of people who received an mrna vaccine (rr = 6.33, 95% ci 1.87-21.40, p = 0.00014) and patients with influenza (rr = 2.67, 95% ci 1.04-6.81, p = 0.031). this was significantly higher than in a matched cohort of people who received an mrna vaccine (rr=4.46, 95% ci 3.12-6.37, p < 0.0001) and patients with influenza (rr=1.43, 95% ci 1.10-1.88, p = 0.0094). 
 So much fake news on this Covid is clearly a  virus and , yes,with a compromised immune system Bacteria will thrive. Covid kills by clotting and, particularly in damaging lung efficiency. Hypoxia can cause heart failure. [SEP] covid-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (hf). the proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. in this review, we discuss our current understanding of covid-19 mediated damage to the cardiovascular system. the sars-cov-2 infection has the potential to cause multi-organ dysfunction. though the virus predominantly affects the lungs, it can affect the heart in myriad ways. heart failure (hf) is one such complication caused by the virus, both in patients with and without cardiovascular diseases. summary: covid-19 can affect the heart in many ways. this article describes the mechanisms, clinical presentations and management of heart failure caused by covid-19 infection. nevertheless, fake news are spreading, alerting parents on dangerous side effects in children, such as hypercapnia, hypoxia, gut dysbiosis and immune system weakness. the outbreak of the sars-cov-2 novel coronavirus (covid-19) has been accompanied by a large amount of misleading and false information about the virus, especially on social media. 
 Covid causes heart inflammation in like 70% of people (including asymptomatic).  That seems like a high rate of heart inflammation. [SEP] evidence that chronic inflammation is associated with the occurrence of cardiac events in people both with and without chronic inflammatory joint disease is emerging. whilst it is likely that chronic systemic inflammation promotes accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients, the mechanisms by which this occurs are complex and the effects of treatment and other cardiovascular risk factors need to be considered. myocarditis is associated with a wide range of infections, most commonly viral, bacterial, and parasitic. inflammation of heart is caused by known infectious agents, viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites, and by toxic materials from the environment, water, food, air, toxic gases, smoke, and pollution, or by an unknown origin. patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of covid-19. there is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in sars-cov-2. myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of covid-19. myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst covid-19 patients. the moderate to severe forms of covid-19 often require hospitalization, are associated with a high rate of mortality, and appear to be caused by an inappropriately exaggerated inflammatory response to the virus. 
  My 6 year old was stressed too.  I just told him some mainicured facts. The AZ vaccine uses a virus which can cause the common cold to transport the material which helps your body learn how to beat COVID. So sometimes you get some similar effects to a cold or flu.  Seemed to help [SEP] this article reviews the common cold and influenza viruses, presents the conventional treatment options, and highlights select botanicals (echinacea spp., sambucus nigra, larch arabinogalactan, astragalus membranaceous, baptisia tinctoria, allium sativa, panax quinquefolium, eleutherococcus senticosus, andrographis paniculata, olive leaf extract, and isatis tinctoria) and nutritional considerations (vitamins a and c, zinc, high lactoferrin whey protein, n-acetylcysteine, and dhea) that may help in the prevention and treatment of these conditions. vaccine hesitancy, especially in the setting of an ongoing covid-19 pandemic and upcoming flu season, may pose a significant burden on us healthcare systems. concerns regarding adverse effects from the flu vaccine was a major barrier to vaccination and family (58.1%) was the primary influencer in participants' decision to get vaccinated. doctors can help educate patients regarding the limited adverse effects of flu vaccines, and include patients and their families in vaccination discussions - because families are influential in the decision-making process - to increase flu vaccination uptake. to further compound the problems, there are considerable challenges to the availability of effective, affordable, safe vaccines on a mass scale. according to the recommendation of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), getting influenza vaccines during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemics is especially important for people with certain underlying medical conditions, like cancer. due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and covid-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. from a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had covid-19 ten days after vaccination. we investigated the effect of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines on the disease course of sars-cov-2 in the pediatric population and the possibility of viral interference. new knowledge of the effects of cytokines in human beings now helps to explain some of the symptoms of colds and flu that were previously in the realm of folklore rather than medicine-eg, fever, anorexia, malaise, chilliness, headache, and muscle aches and pains. 
   I do But they are hardly bad for you also Experimental ones sure   But vaccines save more lives then risk any day  The covid vaccine cause me to vomit and made me very poorly But I hadn't taken vets and my immune system was in tatters so meh [SEP] vaccines represent one of the most effective measures of public health medicine, saving countless lives and preventing lifelong disabilities. vaccines are extremely safe, however, no vaccine is completely free from risks and adverse events can occur following vaccination. among the adverse reactions to vaccines, one of the most feared is the triggering of autoimmune diseases, which are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the immune system. furthermore, epidemiological studies do not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause systemic autoimmune diseases. due to the sars-cov2 pandemic, new types of vaccines have been developed and are now available. unprecedented loss of life due to the covid pandemic has necessitated the development of several vaccines in record time. most of these vaccines have received approval without being extensively whetted for their adverse effect and efficacy profiles. vaccines save millions of lives from infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. most canadian parents make sure that their children are immunized on time, but health care providers often encounter parents who are hesitant about vaccination or refuse recommended vaccines. immunization is one of the most important preventive health measures in existence and responsible for saving millions of lives. 
  Nothing like that ..... Now the reason the vaccine will cause this it's a side effect when one takes the vaccine. Covid-19 does not cause erectile distinction. [SEP] this study aimed to provide evidence on sinopharm covid-19 vaccine side effects. side effects post first vaccine dose of normal injection site pain, fatigue and headache were more common in participants aged ≤49 years versus >49 years, while pain at the vaccination site, fatigue, lethargy, headache and tenderness were the most common side effects post second dose in both groups. most participants were uncertain whether they would experience side effects from a covid-19 vaccine; only a minority reported that side effects were very likely (9.4%, 95% ci 7.9% to 10.9%, n = 138/1470). side-effect expectations were associated with: older age, being clinically extremely vulnerable to covid-19, being afraid of needles, lower perceived social norms for covid-19 vaccination, lower perceived necessity and safety of covid-19 vaccination, and perceived lack of information about covid-19 and vaccination. side-effect expectation was associated with believing that covid-19 vaccination was unsafe, ineffective and that others would be less likely to approve of you having a covid-19 vaccination. men identified concerns surrounding trust in vaccines and the perceived exaggerated risk of covid-19 to them and the population. although individuals are advised to take the vaccine to protect themselves and the people around them from covid-19 infection, many are doubtful about the consequences of the vaccine. after receiving the covid-19 vaccination, recipients should be advised about potential vaccine symptoms, how to handle them, and when and where to seek additional guidance if necessary. this is the first study to evaluate covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among us medical students and highlights the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote uptake of the covid-19 vaccine. vaccine willingness significantly differed by sex and education level, with female participants and those with less than a bachelor's degree being more likely to report unwillingness. 
‼️”all covid-19 vaccines cause deadly blood clots...travel to the brain, heart, lungs & other organs, causing strokes, heart attacks (rapper DMX was killed this way), pulmonary embolisms...&other...none of which...officially listed as "vaccine" deaths” https://t.co/joO5hAIfWV [SEP] the cause of death in single cases was massive pulmonary embolism. the major features in the lungs of covid-19 patients comprised primary inflammatory thrombosis associated with diffuse alveolar damage. hypertension and hypotension occurring within minutes of the other can cause a showering of embolized blood clots to travel to the brain, heart, or lungs. such bad or thrombotic clots occlude blood vessels and cause oxygen starvation of vital organs including the brain (stroke), heart (acute myocardial infarction) or lungs (pulmonary embolism). this patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive pe and deep venous thrombosis (dvt) due to sars-cov2 infection following the administration of the j&j vaccine. blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 infection. remarkably, more than 70% of deaths related to covid-19 are attributed to clotting-associated complications such as pulmonary embolism, strokes and multi-organ failure. moreover, the patients with covid-19 are more susceptible to pulmonary embolism and severe pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. therefore, covid-19 may cause right heart dysfunction by inducing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. this deadly virus affects multiple vital organs (lungs, heart, nervous system, blood, and immune system), yet its exact mechanism of pathophysiology remains obscure. 
"Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may directly cause psychiatric morbidity through cerebral infection or hyperinflammation [2]. Recovery in Long COVID is multi-faceted and we recommend mental health ". [SEP] importantly, the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov-2 may have devastating consequences in the brain. conversely, covid-19 can predispose or aggravate psychiatric disorders, as it induces a cytokine storm, causing systemic hyper inflammation. besides, sars-cov-2 is likely to reach and trigger an inflammatory process directly in the nervous system. sars-cov-2 hyperinflammation is a risk factor for elderly psychiatric disorders. hypothetically, sars-cov-2 may affect the central nervous system (cns) either by direct mechanisms like neuronal retrograde dissemination and hematogenous dissemination, or via indirect pathways. therefore, covid-19 represents a major threat to the field of neuropsychiatry, as both the virus and the potential therapies may induce neurologic as well as psychiatric disorders. from this perspective, this review will discuss the possible neurological manifestations and sequelae of sars-cov-2 infection with emphasis on the probable underlying neurotropic mechanisms. alterations in brain functioning, especially in regions associated with cognition, can result from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and are predicted to result in various psychiatric diseases. recent studies have shown that sars-cov-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (cns). in late 2019, an outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus, sars-cov-2, resulted in high morbidity and mortality in infected humans. 
No theoretical reason to believe COVID vaccine will cause harm to pregnant mothers or unborn child. https://t.co/xHtWkeGhKb [SEP] vaccination during pregnancy can protect both the expecting mother and the unborn and newborn child from infectious diseases. vaccination during pregnancy protects the expecting mother from a severe course of a number of different infectious diseases. maternal immunization has the potential to reduce both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality by protecting women from complications during pregnancy as well as conferring protection for babies who are too young to be vaccinated. concerns included vaccine safety during pregnancy and adverse effects on the unborn baby. some women mentioned that because vaccines are given later in pregnancy, the unborn baby is stronger, so vaccines will not harm them. overall, participants were supportive of maternal vaccination. the main reason given for non-vaccination was lack of knowledge about vaccination in pregnancy. protection of the child (after birth), the government's advice and possible harmful effects of the vaccine for the unborn child had the greatest predictive value for vaccination status. many pregnant women are very cautious about taking antibiotics due to primarily potentially detrimental effects on the unborn child. on the basis of our current state of knowledge, the vast majority of antibiotics do not cause serious harm to the unborn child if used properly and at the appropriate doses during pregnancy. 
 Even Fauci the Gates mouthpiece admits masks do not protect you. Btw corona can get in your eyes, through cloth, on your clothes etc. The mask can recirculate bacteria in your body, affect your immune system, double your co2 intake, cause lung infections etc. Individual choice. [SEP] cloth masks have been used in healthcare and community settings to protect the wearer from respiratory infections. the filtration effectiveness of cloth masks is generally lower than that of medical masks and respirators; however, cloth masks may provide some protection if well designed and used correctly. there is paucity of literature on efficacy of cloth face mask in preventing sars-cov-2 infection transmission; thus, this review aims to update the available most recent evidences on efficacy of cloth face masks in prevention of viral infection transmission. cloth face masks show minimum efficacy in source control than the medical grade mask. to identify scientific evidence on the effectiveness of using cloth masks as safe protectors against covid-19. evidence shows that cloth masks do not have the same protective characteristics as surgical masks, indicating an increased risk of infection due to humidity, diffusion of fluids, virus retention, and improper preparation. standard n95 mask performance was used as a control to compare the results with cloth masks, and our results suggest that cloth masks are only marginally beneficial in protecting individuals from particles<2.5 μm. although in theory, cloth masks can be helpful to limit the spread of the covid-19, serious consideration should be given to the choice of textile, the number of layers of cloth used, pre-treatment of the material with water repellent material and other compounds that can enhance the filtration efficiency of the masks without compromising their breathability. the authors sought to review clinically relevant information on the ultraviolet (uv) shielding properties of masks. overall, cloth masks for the public that are safest against sars-cov-2 are generally also the most protective against uv damage. 
  All vaccines have side effects and in a small % of cases even cause death  The chances of getting/dying from polio were higher than from the Vaccine. So it made sense to take the jab  When it comes to Covid, more children will be hospitalised/die from the vaccine than from Covid [SEP] compared to the placebo, the vaccine prevented: 66.9% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 14 days66.1% of moderate to severe-critical covid-19 cases after 28 days85.4% of severe covid-19 cases after 28 days100% of people with severe covid-19 from needing to go to hospital for treatment none of the vaccinated participants died from covid-19. the people in the study who got the vaccine who went on to get covid-19 generally had milder and fewer symptoms than those who got the placebo. 1196 (<0·1%) individuals were admitted to hospital or died due to covid-19 illness (883 hospitalised, of whom 228 died, and 313 who died due to covid-19 without hospitalisation) 14 days or more after their first vaccine dose. the infectious diseases that remain major causes of mortality for which vaccines have been shown to provide proven preventive success include, in order of prevalence, are those caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, bordetella pertussis, measles virus, haemophilus influenzae type b and influenza virus. objective: the purpose of the present report was to address the global burden of these six vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children < 5 years of age, together with implications for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection in children. we conducted a risk-benefit analysis for australians aged 18-59 years, comparing the risk of vaccination versus infection, and rate of tts to other vaccines which prompted policy change following rare adverse events - rotavirus, smallpox and oral polio vaccines. in australia, the potential risks of the azd1222 vaccine in younger adults, who are at low risk of dying from covid-19, may outweigh the benefits. lastly, participants who believed in the efficacy of the polio vaccination also considered the covid-19 vaccine to be safe and effective. most strategies for reducing covid-19 vaccination hesitancy focus on highlighting the benefits of covid-19 vaccines. we suggest that the dangers of not getting the vaccine should also be emphasized as many people who do not know someone who was affected with covid-19 are also hesitant towards vaccination. 
 They already know for non-rna vaxs that Linked Epitope Suppression will likely cause Most Severe infection for subsequent exposure to Covid after vax (Aka Pathogenic Priming) same as seen wi Dengue vaccine.  They also know that novel RNA/DNA vaxs are likely to spike autoimmunity. [SEP] this study compared the in vitro interactions of the commercially available yellow fever vaccine (yf-vax), dengue virus and the live-attenuated dengue vaccine pdk50 with dendritic cells (dcs), the main antigen-presenting cells at the initiation of immune responses. this is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a covid-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future covid-19 resurgences. recently, pgja-p/vax, a new targeted anti-caries dna vaccine for human trials, was constructed by replacing the pci vector used in the construction of pgja-p with pvax1, the only vector authorized by the us food and drug administration in clinical trials. two immunizations with wn-vax induced high levels of neutralizing antibody to wn virus. immunization with wn-vax induced wn virus-neutralizing antibody in all mice previously immunized with je-vax but in only half of the control mice at 10 weeks. these results indicate that wn-vax induced complete protective immunity against lethal wn infection and that the wn-vax-induced antibody response is facilitated in je-vax-immunized mice. intranasal vaccination with clinical-grade pgja-p/vax induced higher serum igg and salivary siga in both mice and gnotobiotic rats. the coronavirus disease (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) first appeared in wuhan, china in late 2019 and since then has caused unprecedented economic and social disruption as well as presenting a major challenge to public health. despite mass progress in covid-19 vaccination uptake, vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax information has been reported that can delay public acceptance of a vaccine. participants completed an adapted version of the theory of planned behaviour vaccine questionnaire, the vaccine attitudes scale (vax), vaccine confidence scale, and questions on previous experience of covid-19. 
23. The claim that only (severe) #Covid_19 but not influenza may cause venous thrombosis and pulmonary (lung) embolism is not true, as it has been known for 50 years that severe influenza greatly increases the risk of thrombosis and embolism, too. [SEP] considering the high transmission rate of covid-19 and with the seasonal influenza approaching in late 2020, the dual epidemics of covid-19 and influenza pose serious cardiovascular implications. similarly, the frequency of vascular thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is markedly higher in covid-19 patients compared with influenza in which vascular complications are rarely seen. it has been recently reported that capillary microthrombi are significantly more prevalent in patients with covid-19 than in patients with influenza a. venous thrombo-embolic events have been described in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), suggesting the presence of coagulopathy induced by the viral infection. venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms have been observed in covid-19. we evaluated the adjusted risks of thromboembolic events after a diagnosis of covid-19 compared with influenza in a large retrospective cohort. compared with influenza, patients with covid-19 had higher venous thromboembolic risk (hr 1.53, 95% ci 1.38-1.70), but not arterial thromboembolic risk (hr 1.02, 95% ci 0.95-1.10). in a large retrospective us cohort, covid-19 was independently associated with higher 90-day risk for venous thrombosis, but not arterial thrombosis, as compared with influenza. there is some evidence that covid 19 pneumonia is associated with prothrombotic status and increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). thrombotic outcomes in the setting of severe covid 19 pneumonia may include macrovascular venous thromboembolism, microvascular pulmonary vascular thrombosis and arterial thromboembolism. 
A CDC panel says administering Johnson & Johnson shots would save many lives. It could cause about 24 cases of a rare and dangerous clotting disorder, but prevent 1,435 COVID-19 deaths, a CDC staffer and an analysis suggested. https://t.co/k49KoeeWfB [SEP] covid-19 vaccination remains the most effective means to achieve control of the pandemic. in the united states, covid-19 cases and deaths have markedly declined since their peak in early january 2021, due in part to increased vaccination coverage (1). available data indicate that the vaccines authorized in the united states (pfizer-biontech, moderna, and janssen [johnson & johnson]) offer high levels of protection against severe illness and death from infection with the delta variant and other currently circulating variants of the virus (2). on february 27, 2021, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for the janssen covid-19 (ad.26.cov2.s) vaccine (janssen biotech, inc., a janssen pharmaceutical company, johnson & johnson; new brunswick, new jersey), and on february 28, 2021, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued interim recommendations for its use in persons aged ≥18 years (1,2). on april 13, 2021, cdc and fda recommended a pause in the use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine after reports of six u.s. cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) with thrombocytopenia, a rare thromboembolic syndrome, among janssen covid-19 vaccine recipients (3). on april 23, 2021, after a discussion of the benefits and risks of resuming vaccination, acip reaffirmed its interim recommendation for use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine in all persons aged ≥18 years under the fda's eua, which now includes a warning that rare clotting events might occur after vaccination, primarily among women aged 18-49 years. as of july 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the united states had received at least 1 dose of covid-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after covid-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). during the most recent meeting in july 2021, acip determined that, overall, the benefits of covid-19 vaccination in preventing covid-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. to assess vaccine effectiveness (ve) of these three products in preventing covid-19 hospitalization, cdc and collaborators conducted a case-control analysis among 3,689 adults aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized at 21 u.s. hospitals across 18 states during march 11-august 15, 2021. as of january 10, 2021, a reported 4,041,396 first doses of moderna covid-19 vaccine had been administered in the united states, and reports of 1,266 (0.03%) adverse events after receipt of moderna covid-19 vaccine were submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). 
    Exactly but its daft to put yourself in a position where in future life you could be classed as having a chronic illness  from a virus which is highly likely to cause some damage which would put you in a high risk category. you have the chance to protect yourself. Up to you !!! [SEP] outbreaks of infectious etiology, particularly those caused by a novel virus that has no known treatment or vaccine, may result in the interruption of medical care provided to patients with cancer and put them at risk for undertreatment in addition to the risk of being exposed to infection, a life-threatening event among patients with cancer. this article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in saudi arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection. the approach taken toward managing this high-risk situation (covid-19) could be easily adopted by health care organizations and would be helpful to ensure readiness for the occurrence of future outbreaks of different infectious etiologies like those recent episodes of new coronavirus. chronic illness creates additional opportunities for risk because nonadherence behaviors can jeopardize adolescents' health. it is possible that some nonadherence behaviors observed in adolescents with type 1 diabetes may result from youth taking risks with their medical treatment. this article reviews current models of general risk-taking and their implications for diabetes management. the authors argue that illness-specific risk-taking may be an important, understudied aspect of illness management that can inform future studies and treatment of nonadherence in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. this is described in four subthemes: living 1 day at a time, without fear of the virus; feeling taken care of; having limited freedom and missing out on the little extras. contributing to the growing area of covid-19-related research, our findings provide novel insights into how pandemic-related restrictions in nursing homes represent a risk of isolating older people from the outside world and diminishing their freedom. in general, psychological and biographical variables were not strongly related to whether or not the respondents had put others at risk of hiv. 
It’s still unknown how the vaccine could cause blood clots. One potential explanation is that some people develop an immune response that attacks platelets, making them clump together, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine tied to uncommon blood clots, experts.  https://t.co/peLyu8wX25 [SEP] the recent demonstration that chadox1 ncov-19 covid-19 (astrazeneca) vaccine (cha) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-pf4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-covid-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. we assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (saes) documented in the eudravigilance european database up to april 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of cha compared to that of recipients of the bnt162b2 covid-19 (pfizer/biontech) vaccine (bnt). although concerns regarding unusual blood clots and low platelet counts have been raised, the benefits of covid-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks of adverse events.what is the impact?except for children, the covid-19 vaccine is recommended for all people, including those pregnant or immunocompromised. adverse emboli growths with increased d-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the astrazeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt). on 18 march 2021, ema's safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with covid-19 vaccine astrazeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (cvt). we report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine administration. ), are not uncommon following any covid-19 vaccination, one rare vaccine-associated event can cause fatal consequences due to development of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (pf4), which trigger platelet activation, aggregation, and possible resultant thrombosis, often at unusual vascular sites. vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (vitt) is a rare complication after vaccination of oxford-astrazeneca coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccine (azd1222) or janssen covid-19 vaccine. in spring 2021, venous blood clots and thrombocytopenia were described in some vaccine recipients. comparison between the frequency of saes and sae-related deaths in cha and ad26 vs. bnt162b2 covid-19 (bnt) (pfizer/biontech) vaccine recipients demonstrated: 1) cha and ad26 recipients than bnt recipients had higher frequencies of not only saes caused by venous blood clots and hemorrhage, but also thromboembolic disease and arterial events, including myocardial infarction and stroke; 2) a corresponding higher frequency of sae-related deaths. 
 Truly sorry to hear for your loss. However, the vaccination is NOT safe. It will not save you and will cause problems to your body. FDA has not yet approved any of Covid vaccines but said can be used for emergency purposes. There is a big difference. I do not trust the vaccine. [SEP] the current pandemic has inspired researchers to make every effort to design and develop an effective covid-19 vaccine to provide sufficient protection against the virus and control the infection. the aim of this article is to provide a review of the attempts made to develop safe sars-cov-2 vaccines, highlighting potential challenges and concerns, such as disease enhancement, virus mutations, and public acceptance of the vaccine. here, we review the approval process and safety profiles of fda approved vaccines and discuss some of the challenges currently facing the fda regarding the sars-cov-2 vaccine approval. the ad26.cov2.s vaccine by johnson and johnson (new brunswick, new jersey) is the only adenovirus-based vaccine and deemed relatively effective and safe by the us food and drug administration (fda) following its clinical trial. three covid-19 vaccines are currently approved under a biologics license application (bla) or authorized under an emergency use authorization (eua) by the food and drug administration (fda) and recommended for primary vaccination by the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) in the united states: the 2-dose mrna-based pfizer-biontech/comirnaty and moderna covid-19 vaccines and the single-dose adenovirus vector-based janssen (johnson & johnson) covid-19 vaccine (1,2) (box 1). on 11 december 2020, the us fda granted an emergency use authorization for the first covid-19 vaccine, and vaccines are now widely available. after emergency use authorization of moderna covid-19 vaccine by fda, acip issued an interim recommendation for use of moderna covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years at its december 19, 2020, emergency meeting (2). the development of covid vaccines is reviewed. three covid-19 vaccines are authorized or approved for use among adults in the united states (1,2). although these real-world data suggest some variation in levels of protection by vaccine, all fda-approved or authorized covid-19 vaccines provide substantial protection against covid-19 hospitalization. 
    COVID attacks the lungs which causes inflammation, especially with people suffering from NCD's. The body responds to inflammation with a cykotine response, which causes, and I quote, significant changes in motor activity and motivation as well as anxiety, arousal, and alarm" [SEP] activation of the inflammatory response leads to release of inflammatory cytokines and mobilization of immune cells both of which have been shown to access the brain and alter behavior. through their effects on neurotransmitter systems, cytokines impact neurocircuits in the brain including the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex, leading to significant changes in motor activity and motivation as well as anxiety, arousal, and alarm. patients with severe covid-19 suffer from life-threatening respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome in their lungs, a leading cause of covid-19 mortality. this lung hyper-inflammation is induced by virus-caused massive tissue damage that is associated with uncontrolled cytokine release, known as a cytokine storm, through jak/stat signaling pathways. coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. with increasing literature, this systematic literature review aimed to address the mental health effects of covid-19 on people with ncd in addition to examine the impact of the pandemic on treatments/resources for ncd. sars-cov-2 causes a severe pneumonia (covid-19) that affects essentially elderly people. in covid-19, macrophage infiltration into the lung causes a rapid and intense cytokine storm leading finally to a multi-organ failure and death. to clarify the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 caused lung inflammation and injury, from the molecular mechanism to lung damage and tissue repair, from research to clinical practice, and then presented clinical requirements. we comprehensively reviewed the process of lung inflammation and injury during sars-cov-2 infection, including pyroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, cytokine storm, and thrombotic inflammatory mechanisms. 
 Yes, I'm doing the same, watching other countries. I have a rare autoimmune disease + take various immunosuppressants as my body is always fighting its own immune system. Understanding how Covid19 can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response resulting in a Cytokine storm /... [SEP] the covid-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. in addition, the covid-19 infection has contributed a great deal to our comprehension of the role of antibodies in the causation of cytokine storms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also seen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. in this paper, we review clinical studies on the use of mscs for covid-19 treatment, including the salutary effects of mscs on the pathophysiology of covid-19 and the immunomodulation of the cytokine storm. the clinical progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, coronavirus 2019 (covid-19), to critical illness is associated with an exaggerated immune response, leading to magnified inflammation termed the "cytokine storm." elevated levels of inflammatory markers in covid-19 (e.g., d-dimer, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6) are reminiscent of the cytokine storm seen in severe hyperinflammatory macrophage disorders. this review highlights the importance of understanding the immunologic mechanisms of covid-19 as they inform the clinical presentation and suggest potential therapeutic targets. in this article, we discuss the pathogenic consequences of the cytokine storm and its relationship with covid-19 associated risk factors. the increased pro-inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, copd) exacerbates the cytokine-storm of covid-19 into a 'cytokine super cyclone'. the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) mediated by corona virus 2 (covid19) is a global health concern and various countries witnessed the loss of precious human life. in fall 2020, the absence of specific suitable medication or vaccine is still a major cause of concern to fight the pandemic while different countries have already started using their own medication and available resources to save the life of their citizens. 
  Pneumonia and bronchitis are inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria or viruses, including the virus which causes COVID. So your statement really doesn't make much sense as pneumonia and bronchitis are both possible symptoms of COVID. [SEP] acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough due to acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways without evidence of pneumonia. acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease. the rapid spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia has posed complex challenges to global public health. the covid-19 is an acute and contagious disease characterized by pneumonia and ards. the pathogenesis of covid-19 is highly complex and involves suppression of host antiviral and innate immune response, induction of oxidative stress followed by hyper inflammation described as the "cytokine storm," causing the acute lung injury, tissue fibrosis, and pneumonia. the second covid-19 pneumonia patient had a history of diabetes and chronic bronchitis. infectious pneumonias are inflammations of the lung that can be localized in the alveoli or interstitial tissue or both. usually, purulent chronic bronchitis or an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is based on a prior viral infection or an impairment of bacterial clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract. this new cov has caused severe pneumonia in china and rapidly spreads around the world, the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 is associated with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome causing significant morbidity and mortality. 
Covid-19 vaccines initiates an early and progressive clotting of blood in the lungs (pulmonary thrombosis) which impairs blood supply and gas exchange at lungs, leading to respiratory failure, which in majority of cases cause death. [SEP] sars-cov-2 infection induces cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome with progressive lung damage, multiple organ failure, and even death. sars-cov-2 mainly targets the lungs and blood, leading to ards, and systemic thrombosis or bleeding. immunothrombosis occurs at the site of infection due to innate immune inflammatory and coagulofibrinolytic responses to sars-cov-2, resulting in microvascular occlusion with hypoperfusion of the lungs. blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 infection. remarkably, more than 70% of deaths related to covid-19 are attributed to clotting-associated complications such as pulmonary embolism, strokes and multi-organ failure. here, we report a case of a child with an unusual presentation of covid-19 presented initially by dry cough without fever and complicated by massive acute pulmonary embolism and lung infarction and treated successfully by hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, in addition to anticoagulant therapy. pulmonary microvascular injury and thrombosis are increasingly reported as constitutive features of covid-19 respiratory failure. we suspect that severe covid-19 pneumonia causes respiratory failure via pulmonary microthrombi and endothelial dysfunction. we suspect that severe covid-19 pneumonia causes respiratory failure via pulmonary microthrombi and endothelial dysfunction. the novel coronavirus gains entry into humans by targeting the ace2 receptor that found on lung cells, which destroy human lungs through cytokine storms, and this leads to hyperinflammation, forcing the immune cells to destroy healthy cells. 
Up to half of hospitalized COVID patients have elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, or antibodies that cause blood clots to form. Patients with these antibodies are much more likely to have severe respiratory disease and kidney injury. #COVID19 [SEP] patients with covid-19 are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. these findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with covid-19 become at least transiently positive for apl antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic. second, c-reactive protein (crp) is highly elevated in covid-19 patients, and also associated with severity. infection caused by novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, sars-cov-2) has been associated with coagulopathy. transient elevation of apla from the viral illness may play a role in thrombosis associated with covid-19. coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19)-associated coagulopathy is a hallmark of disease severity and poor prognosis. the key manifestations of this prothrombotic syndrome-microvascular thrombosis, stroke, and venous and pulmonary clots-are also observed in severe and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. the association with markers of inflammation and coagulation, clinical severity, and mortality suggests a causal role of apl in covid-19-associated coagulopathy. to explore the association of thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers with severity in coronavirus disease (covid-19), we measured antiphospholipid antibodies (apl) and calprotectin in sera of covid-19 patients. blood clots are a central feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) and can culminate in pulmonary embolism, stroke, and sudden death. 
   Along those same lines, if my loved one dies straight after getting a covid vaccination, can I get the hospital to state the cause of death was the vaccine?  If it's good for COVID then it must be good for the vaccines as well?   #COVID19Aus #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine #uspol [SEP] all patients who were not vaccinated in february 2021 (baseline) were re-approached a month later to assess whether they had gotten vaccinated since. the majority of patients suffering from a severe mental illness are willing to get vaccinated, and their decision of whether or not to get vaccinated is based on their viewpoint on the vaccine rather than being an outcome of their level of distress (oq-45). it is important to allow vaccine accessibility to hospitalized patients, to consider their opinions and to provide useful information to lower vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination rates. further, participants with good knowledge about the vaccine and its side effects are more willing to get the vaccine. the availability of a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine in palestine is crucial to decrease the burden of covid-19 morbidity and mortality. the aims of the present study were (1) to identify the variables related to denying the justification for vaccination during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic in taiwan and (2) to examine the associations of such denial with perceived risk of covid-19 and the extrinsic and intrinsic intentions to get vaccinated against covid-19. multiple variables related to denying the justification for vaccination; the denial was negatively associated with the intention to get vaccinated against covid-19. this suggests a need to intensify evidence-based yet simplified messaging by esteemed healthcare providers to inform the public on the risks and benefits of vaccines. the majority of university students intend to get the covid-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. ensuring that family doctors, pharmacists, and other front-line healthcare workers have consistent and clear information regarding the benefits of vaccination will be critical to encouraging uptake among young adults. 
Chronic stress could cause problems for your baby. These can include effects on your unborn baby’s growth and the length of gestation.[NEWLINE]#healthdisparities #blacklivesmatter #covid #publichealth #health #socialdeterminantsofhealth #healthequity https://t.co/4JgSKue9tQ [SEP] healthcare professionals should not delay an examination if a mother-to-be is worried about her unborn baby's wellbeing. pregnant women who are at risk of preterm birth are often stressed, anxious and depressed because of worries and fears related to the health of the unborn baby, their own health and uncertainty about the future. this is particularly important in babies of less than 28 weeks' gestation, who currently remain at serious risk of chronic lung disease and permanent retinal damage. having a new baby admitted to a neonatal unit often triggers stress and anxiety for parents. the intermingling of covid-19 restrictions and world prematurity day allows for an understanding of both the additional stresses incurred as a consequence of the pandemic and the more "everyday" experiences in the nicu and beyond. these themes highlight the multi-level challenges faced by parents of premature babies and the healthcare professionals involved in their care. in accordance with our hypothesis, depression was related to the mother's more negative expectations on their relationship with the unborn baby and on regularity in the baby's sleeping and eating patterns. on the other hand, stress, anxiety and adverse life events were not related to the mother's expectations of her unborn baby. the factors including maternal problems, prenatal problems, early neonatal problems, nutrition, familial socioeconomical status and presence of chronic disease which affected catch-up growth in terms of height and weight in vlbw infants followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) of our hospital were examined. the risk factors related with failure to achieve target height were found to include ventilator treatment, presence of chronic disease, advanced stage intracranial bleeding (icb), posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, absence of breastfeeding, failure to sit at the table with the family and malnutrition. 
 I've heard heart disease and cancer death tolls down 50-60% because if patient tested positive for Covid 19, Covid 19 was reported as their cause of death.  Is this true? [SEP] the department of public health conducts surveillance for covid-19-associated deaths: persons who died of nontraumatic/nonaccidental causes within 60 days of a positive covid-19 test result were classified as confirmed covid-19 deaths. the sars-cov-2 pandemic is accompanied by an ever-rising death toll attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), but questions have persisted regarding deaths formally attributed to covid-19. this retrospective review of cause of death has demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of hospitalised patients with positive sars-cov-2 pcr died as a direct consequence of covid-19 infection. covid-19 is reported as the cause of death in 50% of covid-19 positive patients with cancer. the aim of the present study was to examine death certificates of persons who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) to (a) quantify the number of deaths directly caused by coronavirus 2019 (covid-19); (b) estimate the most common complications leading to death; and (c) identify the most common comorbidities. deaths due to covid-19 were defined as those in which covid-19 was the underlying cause of death. discussion: in most persons dying after testing positive for sars-cov-2, covid-19 was the cause directly leading to death. moreover, it was observed that covid-19 significantly increased the odds of covid-19-related death in diabetes patients (or = 1.45, ci 95%: 1.02, 2.06, p = 0.036). countries that include only patients in which covid-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. infection with covid-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. 
Fact: The COVID-19 vaccine will NOT give you #COVID19. None of the vaccines currently in development or use in the U.S. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. But, as the #vaccine helps you build #immunity, the process can sometimes cause symptoms, such as a fever. https://t.co/SJV4eGWDAj [SEP] this paper provides a review of the current developments of potential covid-19 vaccines around the world. vaccines against covid-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. to help stop the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, vaccines are currently the most critical tool. however, the covid-19 mrna vaccines frequently cause systemic side effects shortly after the injection, such as fever, headache and generalized fatigue. however, there are concern about the new covid-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. in addition, both coronavirus and covid-19 vaccine are new at this point and there is no scientific evidence to know whether people who are vaccinated can still carry the covid 19 pathogens and pass them along to others. although many of these vaccines are undergoing pre-clinical trials, several large clinical trials investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccines have produced promising findings. in this review, we provide a status update on covid-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials and discuss issues of concern beyond vaccine efficacy and safety, including dosing regimens, the mixed vaccine strategy, prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, antibody levels, cellular immunity and protection, variants of concern, covid-19 vaccine distribution, vaccination willingness, herd immunity, immunity passports, and vaccine indications. while the knowledge and development of covid-19 vaccines is rapidly expanding, the benefits of covid-19 vaccines must outweigh the potential risks of adverse events. the development and implementation of the covid-19 vaccine could be an important measure to control the covid-19 pandemic.what is new?several phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of covid-19 vaccines for the prevention of sars-cov-2 infections. 
     Let's all get one thing straight:  The virus in question is a beta-coronavirus called SARS-COV-2. It itself is a variant of SARS-COV, and related to MERS-COV.  The virus is claimed to cause a recognized (yet disputed) list of symptoms. This list is known as COVID-19. [SEP] covid-19, a respiratory disease caused by the sars-cov-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the world health organization (who) on 11 march 2020. sars-cov-2 virus was first identified in the beginning of 2020 and has spread all over the world, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the virus is a member of the coronavirus family, which includes viruses that cause common cold, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is one of the seven known coronaviruses infecting humans; hku1, 229e, nl63, oc43, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), and sars-cov-2, the last three of which can cause severe symptoms in patients. sars-cov-2 (or 2019-ncov) is the novel coronavirus that affects humans. sars-cov-2 causes the disease known as covid-19 (coronavirus disease - 2019), and until may 21, 2020, approximately 213 countries and territories had been affected by sars-cov-2. in the past two decades, two beta-coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sars-cov-1) and the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (mers-cov), have infected approximately 8000 and 2500 across the globe, respectively (de wit et al. in the past two decades, two beta-coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sars-cov-1) and the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (mers-cov), have infected approximately 8000 and 2500 across the globe, respectively (de wit et al. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the causative virus for the current global pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). sars-cov-2 belongs to the family of single-stranded rna viruses known as coronaviruses, including the mers-cov and sars-cov that cause middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), respectively. 
“Patients brought into hospital with heart attack symptoms have later been found to be suffering from cardiac inflammation caused by the virus...it can begin as a kidney infection, or as meningitis, before going on to cause respiratory problems.” #COVID19  https://t.co/tlVDUjp8Q8 [SEP] and recently, during the 2019-ncov pandemic, it was found that the novel coronavirus not only induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) but also can induce damages in various organs including the liver, heart, and kidney. the covid19 pandemic has impacted the lives and health of persons worldwide and although majority of covid19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, pain emerges as an important feature of covid19 infection. for unclear reasons, viral reactivation can cause acute myocarditis, a leading cause of sudden death in the young. influenza a/h1n1(2009) virus (iav/h1n1) is known for causing flu/pneumonia, but the heart is rarely involved. a 5-year old girl had a flu-like syndrome, when she suddenly presented with a respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. pvb19 was detected in the heart with a high viral load. in our case, viral loads suggested a reactivated pvb19-induced acute myocarditis during an iav/h1n1 pneumonia. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, alzheimer's, etc. while most infections cause mild symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, there have been cases in which cardiac involvement has been reported. myocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart tissue, which can be caused by viral infection, thus becoming viral myocarditis. 
 Polio vaccine underwent the largest clinical trial for its time.  COVID passed through the EUA process.   Science is telling us two of the vaccines cause blood clots.  People are allowed to make logical judgements on what they do or dont put in their body. [SEP] the covid-19 vaccines are being developed rapidly, compared to traditional vaccines, and are being approved via emergency use authorization (eua) worldwide. in this review, we have discussed the different type of vaccines with examples of covid-19 vaccines, their rapid development compared to the traditional vaccine, associated challenges, and future prospects. on february 27, 2021, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for the janssen covid-19 (ad.26.cov2.s) vaccine (janssen biotech, inc., a janssen pharmaceutical company, johnson & johnson; new brunswick, new jersey), and on february 28, 2021, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued interim recommendations for its use in persons aged ≥18 years (1,2). on april 13, 2021, cdc and fda recommended a pause in the use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine after reports of six u.s. cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) with thrombocytopenia, a rare thromboembolic syndrome, among janssen covid-19 vaccine recipients (3). on april 23, 2021, after a discussion of the benefits and risks of resuming vaccination, acip reaffirmed its interim recommendation for use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine in all persons aged ≥18 years under the fda's eua, which now includes a warning that rare clotting events might occur after vaccination, primarily among women aged 18-49 years. while development of vaccines has been the major focus, uncertainties around new vaccine safety and effectiveness have spawned interest in other pharmacological options. while covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorization (eua) deemed the vaccines to be effective and safe for public use, the phase 3 trials leading to eua predominantly excluded patients with immunocompromising conditions. however, recent retrospective trials have provided reassuring safety data of the covid-19 vaccine in immunocompromised patients, and the interim analysis of the moderna phase 3 trial produced promising efficacy data on hiv-infected patients. so far, nine kinds of covid-19 vaccines have passed the phase iii clinical trials and have approved for use. this paper focuses on the adverse effects of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia caused by the covid-19 vaccine, especially the adenovirus-vector vaccine from astrazeneca and pfizer, and discusses its mechanism and possible countermeasures. 
I know no system is perfect, so I share this with that in mind - Getting #COVID in #EmergencyRooms - I found only one small study that says low risk.  More #research needs to be done, as this was the cause in my family! [NEWLINE]I beg to differ! [NEWLINE]https://t.co/HEeEWQyH75 https://t.co/AXWgzLhwWD [SEP] the perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that covid-19 vaccines are "not safe at all". beliefs about one's risk of getting covid-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get covid-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting covid-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted covid-19. covid-19 pandemic has had huge impact on health care system and put the health care system under strain, so efforts made to minimize the elective surgeries however some surgeries especially those for high risk malignant tumors cannot be postponed.the aim of this case report is to highlight the importance of screening cancer patients and those with co-morbidities such as renal impairment for covid-19 and encouraging them to get vaccinated before undergoing elective surgeries. although intra-hospital contagion of covid-19 is not rare, increased risk of acquiring covid-19 among cancer patient particularly if they have co-morbidities like renal impairment should be kept in mind and strict protective measures for covid-19 for those patients should be done before, during and after the procedure. our views and opinions presented in this article will draw attention to prevent and reduce the consequences of covid-19 in bmap. assessing the possibility of coronavirus infection and its risk on an individual's life, estimating the spatial transmission risk based on the dynamic condition of a particular place into consideration, and communicating the same to the public is crucial for minimizing the potential impact of covid-19. covira (https://covira.info) is an open-source web-based software that captures the response, calculates personal as well as regional risk, and displays the result to the end-user in the form of maps and risk cards. this evidence-based review is aimed at providing guidance for pharmacists in community, hospital and other settings in south africa, on the management of patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, or covid-19. this guidance document takes into account and includes newly available evidence and recommendations, particularly around the following aspects relating to covid-19: epidemiologythe virus, its modes of transmission and incubation periodsymptom identification, including the differentiation between influenza, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis and covid-19social media myths and misinformationtreatment guidelines and medicines that may need to be kept in stocktreatment and prevention options, including an update on vaccine developmentthe case for and against the use of nsaids, ace-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) in patients with covid-19interventions and patient counselling by the pharmacist. key websites that can be relied upon are: world health organization (who): https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019national institute for communicable diseases (nicd): https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/covid-19/national department of health (ndoh): http://www.health.gov.za/index.php/outbreaks/145-corona-virus-outbreak/465-corona-virus-outbreak; https://sacoronavirus.co.za/. 
   The 10,000 deaths are those caused by Covid alone, excluding anyone who may have had cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure or any other number of preexisting conditions.  The 200,000 is a real number that is still climbing.  Time to re-educate yourself. [SEP] in 2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467,000 (95% confidence interval [ci] 436,000-500,000) and 395,000 (372,000-414,000) deaths, accounting for about one in five or six deaths in us adults. excess death estimates capture deaths both directly and indirectly caused by covid-19. an estimated 2.88 million deaths occurred between march and december 2020. compared with the number of expected deaths based on 2019 data, 477 200 excess deaths occurred during this period, with 74% attributed to covid-19. compared with white males and females, non-covid-19 excess deaths per 100 000 persons were 2 to 4 times higher in black, ai/an, and latino males and females, including deaths due to diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and alzheimer disease. there were profound racial/ethnic disparities in excess deaths in the united states in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic, resulting in rapid increases in racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020. the sars-cov-2 has infected more than 3 million people and caused more than 240,000 death globally. among the covid-19 patients, the prevalence of people with other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease is much higher than others. this discovery may shed light on the high incidence of diabetes in covid-19. we projected the expected number of chd deaths in 2020 if 2006 age- and sex-specific chd death rates remained constant, which would result in ≈480 000 chd deaths in 2020 (12% increase). 
In a few decades there's gonna be a section in history books about the #pandemicbabies that caused a spike in the population similar to the #babyboomers after ww2. #pandemic #COVID19 #coronavirus #StayHome #Quarantine [SEP] the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) is on the rise in the kingdom of jordan. on march 11, 2020 covid19 was declared pandemic by the who and as of may 1, 2020 covid19 disease continues to grow rapidly with 3,400,595 cases and 239,583 deaths world-wide. today, we are witnessing the so-called "second wave" covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with an increasing number of cases similar to the one reported at the beginning of the current year. a simplified model of covid-19 epidemic dynamics under quarantine conditions and method to estimate quarantine effectiveness are developed. the model is developed on the basis of collected epidemiological data of covid19 pandemic, which shows that the daily growth rate of new infections has tendency to decrease linearly when the quarantine is imposed in a country (or a region) until it reaches a constant value, which corresponds to the effectiveness of quarantine measures taken in the country. the coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, along with quarantine, can have devastating consequences for individuals' mental and social health. first recognized in december 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11, 2020. we live at the time of the coronavirus pandemic in the world (1, 2). the ongoing 2020 coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic is an enormous challenge for the health systems and the entire societies of the countries involved. one of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current covid-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread. 
Stop calling it a vaccine!! Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick. Covid shot doesnt [SEP] a booster dose of haemophilus influenzae type b-neisseria meningitidis serogroup c conjugate (hib-menc-tt) vaccine simultaneously administered with measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine in 13- to 14-month-old spanish toddlers, primed with 3 doses of a combined diphteria-tetanus-acellular pertusis dtpa-hib-containing vaccine and a menc-crm197 conjugate vaccine, had a good reactogenicity profile and induced similar hib and menc booster responses and mmr seropositivity rates as the vaccines given alone. administration of an acellular pertussis-containing quadrivalent pre-school booster (td(5)ap-ipv; repevax), with or without measles, mumps and rubella (m-m-rii) vaccine, induced robust antibody responses indicative of protection, regardless of the vaccine used for the primary series. the presence of bacteria in the nasopharynx (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus) was compared before and after the administration of dtp-hib-hepb and measles-yellow fever vaccines. nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage is unaffected by dtp-hib-hepb vaccination and reduced after measles-yellow fever vaccination. this study was undertaken to assess the co-administration of an experimental measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (mmrv, glaxosmithkline biologicals) with a combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis b-inactivated poliovirus-haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib) vaccine in healthy children. healthy children aged 12-23 months (n = 451) were randomised to one of three parallel groups to receive one dose of mmrv vaccine co-administered with a booster dose of dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine (co-administration group), or one dose of mmrv vaccine alone (mmrv group), or a booster dose of dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine alone (dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib group). co-administration of the mmrv vaccine with a booster dose of dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine was well-tolerated and did not exacerbate the reactogenicity profile of either vaccine. in summary, glaxosmithkline biologicals' experimental mmrv vaccine was immunogenic and well-tolerated when administered with a booster dose of dtpa-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine during the second year of life. these vaccines included: diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, hepatitis b (recombinant) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine combined; 7-valent streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide conjugate vaccine; measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; and varicella vaccine. conjugated polysaccharide or toxoid vaccines). 
   Btw- it’s driving me bonkers that people are acting like the pandemic is over.. variants, how long the vaccine is effective is concerning, breakthrough cases in the vaccinated. Even Asymptotic covid can cause long term problems! [SEP] the emerging sars-cov-2 variants and mutants are posing high public health concerns owing to their rapid transmissibility, higher severity, and in some cases, ability to infect vaccinated people (vaccine breakthrough). since late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (sars-cov-2), has killed over three million people. while advances in the treatment of covid-19 have been made, the advent of highly effective vaccines against this coronavirus variant has given hope that the end of the pandemic may be near. an effective vaccine may help us to exit the covid-19 pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has resulted in high mortality and morbidity worldwide and is still a growing problem. in this article, we present breakthroughs and challenges in vaccine development for covid-19 pandemic, discussing issues related to pandemic preparedness and their implications for circular bioeconomy and sustainability. notwithstanding the unprecedented accelerated speed of covid-19 vaccine development, just 9 months after the emergence of the pandemic in wuhan, china, benefiting from previous developments in sars and mers vaccines, significant gaps persist in global vaccine preparedness. the global effort to vaccinate people against sars-cov-2 in the midst of an ongoing pandemic has raised questions about the nature of vaccine breakthrough infections and the potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit the virus. the covid-19 pandemic has affected the world for more than a year, with multiple waves of infections resulting in morbidity, mortality and disruption to the economy and society. we examined the evidence for a vaccine-driven covid-19 exit strategy including academic papers, governmental reports and epidemiological data, and discuss the shift from the current pandemic footing to an endemic approach similar to influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. 
   Getting Covid causes your body to make antibodies against the virus (probably more than one type).  The vaccine cause the body to make one very specific antibody.  This mixed immunity is probably very good [SEP] to evaluate the interference of passively acquired antibodies with vaccine efficacy, macaques (n = 16) were vaccinated with live attenuated measles vaccine in the presence or absence of passively acquired measles virus-specific monkey serum antibodies. this effect was also demonstrated in monkeys vaccinated with live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the hemagglutinin and fusion proteins of measles virus but not in monkeys vaccinated with the same proteins incorporated into immune-stimulating complexes. the aim of our article is to summarize the current knowledge on the immunity acquired following sars-cov-2 infection and to present the results of antibody testing from four czech laboratories which have been measuring these antibodies for over one year. the rollout of covid-19 vaccines brings hope for successful pandemic mitigation and getting the transmission of sars-cov-2 under control. it needs to be stressed, however, that the reported cases are currently sporadic and that the benefits of covid-19 vaccines vastly outweigh their potential risks. active immunity runs parallel with titre of neutralizing antibodies so long as one is dealing with one strain of virus. understanding immune reactivity against sars-cov-2 is essential for coping with the covid-19 pandemic. others produce antibodies and do not get covid-19 but transmit the virus to others ("protective" immunity). apart from natural immune responses, vaccination against sars-cov-2 turned out to be very effective and much safer than naturally acquired immunity. presently there is no approved vaccine so everyone is susceptible but people with co-morbidities appear to be in more risk and the best way for protection is social distancing and increasing one's natural immunity by taking healthy diet and exercise. 
   No you cannot get sticker from wearing your mask. It says that if you have moderate to severe asthma that covid-19 can exacerbate things and possibly cause pneumonia [SEP] wearing masks against 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others. during the covid-19 pandemic, the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization strongly recommend that people wear face masks to cover their mouths and noses while they are out and about in any other public area. asthmatics do not appear to have increased susceptibility to covid-19.uncontrolled severe asthma may be associated with worsened covid-19 outcomes, especially in asthmatics managed with oral corticosteroids. rationale: patients with asthma were advised to avoid coronavirus disease (covid-19) and comply with medication during the covid-19 pandemic. there has not been evidence suggesting the link between covid-19 and asthma exacerbation, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. we present an asthmatic 12-year old girl with cough, wheeze, and mild pneumonia due to covid-19. covid-19 may present with mild pneumonia in children or with an exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children. to search for evidence on whether having asthma increases the risk of poor outcomes of covid-19 and report on recommendations on optimal asthma management in times of covid-19. patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by sars-cov-2 nor they are at risk of complications of covid-19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk. in general, patients with asthma are not at risk of covid-19 morbidity or mortality.

At the moment there’s every reason to suggest that people with autoimmune diseases ought to get either of these vaccines when they get rolled out.”“ [SEP] three immunological objections are raised: vaccines cause antigenic overload, natural immunity is safer and better than vaccine-induced immunity, and vaccines induce autoimmunity. theoretically, vaccines could trigger autoimmunity by means of cytokine production, anti-idiotypic network, expression of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens, modification of surface antigens and induction of novel antigens, molecular mimicry, bystander activation, epitope spreading, and polyclonal activation of b cells. vaccines are not a source of autoimmune diseases. by contrast, absolute evidence exists that infectious agents can trigger autoimmune mechanisms and that they do cause autoimmune diseases. although the rarity of autoimmune diseases makes it difficult to strictly exclude that, albeit exceptionally, some vaccines may induce an autoimmune neurological disease, no definitive demonstration of a potential role of vaccines in causing autoimmune neurological syndromes is presently available. we conducted a survey to evaluate the tolerability of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) mrna vaccines in patients with tets, including individuals with preexisting ad. whilst there is a paucity of long-term safety and efficacy data of covid-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases, the current evidence strongly suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of adverse effects and disease flares. the potential association between vaccination and autoimmune diseases has been largely questioned in the past few years, but this assumption has mostly been based on case reports. the available evidence derived from several negative epidemiological studies is reassuring and at least indicates that vaccines are not a major cause of autoimmune diseases. we suggest that a potential link between vaccines and autoimmune diseases cannot be definitely ruled out and should be carefully explored during the development of new candidate vaccines. 
  If it's unclear it can't be reported.  The death has to be contributed from Covid because Covid causes the respiratory issues etc that cause the death, Covid caused it.  Like lung cancer if death because their lung stopped functioning because of cancer they died from lung cancer. [SEP] cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death after covid-19 diagnosis. while sars-cov-2-triggered hyperinflammatory tissue-damaging and immunothrombotic responses are thought to be major causes of respiratory failure and death, how they relate to lung immunopathological changes remains unclear. here we analyzed postmortem lung specimens from four patients who succumbed to covid-19 and four patients who died from a covid-19-unrelated cause. clinical factors associated with increased risk of death because of covid-19 were age over 65 years, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status > 0 zero, best supportive care, primary lung cancer, and the presence of lung metastases. this report presents detailed histopathological findings in two non-neoplastic subjects whose out-of-hospital deaths were caused by covid-19 infection. assessment of the causative association between the covid-19 and cause of death has been hampered by limited availability of systematically performed autopsies. we aimed to present autopsy-confirmed causes of death in patients who died with covid-19 and to assess the association between thrombosis and diffuse alveolar damage consistent with covid-19 (dad). covid-19 caused or contributed to death in 71% of clinical and 83% of forensic autopsies, in whom significant dad was observed. of the patients with covid-19 as the primary cause of death, only 19% had no thrombotic phenomena in the lungs, as opposed to 38% amongst those with covid-19 as a contributing cause of death and 54% amongst patients whose death was not related to covid-19 (p = 0.002). in medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. during this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive sars-cov-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety.
